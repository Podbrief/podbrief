The hosts question the value of the patents and whether they provide a sufficient competitive advantage.\n\nMoving on to the company's brand, the hosts discuss its established reputation in the sports and military markets. They consider the potential growth opportunities and target markets for the company's products.

They weigh the merits of such ventures, considering the potential for novelty and profit.\n\nReturning to the acquisition deal, the hosts express skepticism about the company's asking price of $300 million. They highlight the need for a thorough assessment of the company's financials and market potential to determine its realistic value.
