- Even my own personal use, I've kind of hit that plateau where I'm like, okay, it fits into my workflows here, doesn't fit into it here, and I'm more productive because of it.

- You have to be driven by something to even consider the exercise of writing a book.

- "Science fiction is influential, and it can shape our perception and understanding of technology and AI."

- Don't dismiss it, leverage it but don't lean on it that it's your only source of information. Like you've got to be wise and you've got to direct it like 30% your code is being written by it. But those are still your ideas.

- I'm doing this big thing and I don't even know if people are gonna like it for years. What am I doing?

- It's like well better than what I came up with. I do think like by the nature of what they're trained on they're going to take like the median, you know, quality level. So I don't think GPT is ever going to write a particularly good book if it's trained on just all the books that are out there, it'll write an okay one, but you're not going to like push the envelope.

- We live in a very strange universe.

- It's sickly good. Yeah, and it writes like 30% of my code too. Like Copilot writes 30% of my code nowadays. And I think non-tech people don't realize that it's a powerful transformation tool. They think it's just a Q&A tool, which is too bad. So I think they'd get a lot of use out of it as a transformation tool.

- I don't need to worry about these people scared of the future. Like what are they so afraid of? Do they think literally these machines are going to construct robots are going to take over Boston Dynamics? And like next thing you know, the company isn't ran by the company more. Now it's ran by some machine that manifests the corporation and pays the taxes and bills the things like the humans are just subjects of this control. Yeah, probably not. Yes, is actually the short answer. That's what's going to happen.
