- The company being discussed is in the sports protection industry

- A strategic purchase by a larger sports equipment company could be a possibility if the patent portfolio and market growth potential align.

- The valuation of $300 million is considered to be unrealistic

- The potential business acquisition is a 15-year-old brand in the sports and military protective gear segments with a massive IP portfolio and a 40% repeat customer rate. The asking price is $300 million.- Okay, back to the listing. Website Closers presents a rare opportunity for an investor to acquire this 15-year-old premier company operating in the rapidly growing sports and military protected markets.

- I've said that to sellers before when they're like, okay, I want this. I'm like, okay, do you think your business is gonna grow? Nah, probably not. Okay, do you know it will take me 14 years to get all my money back? Do you know I'll be dead by then?

- The good news is if you buy this business and you don't grow it, it will take you 140 years to get your money back.

- The valuation's obviously just not realistic, unless there's some company out there that is doing something similar and these patents are just the thing they need to take off.

- Okay, shoot. Did you know left-handed people die on average younger than right-handed people?

- We would love to own this business as an e-commerce business, not as a $300 million venture play on an IP portfolio.

- I think this business is in a nice niche. You are not selling athletic equipment. You're in the business of selling peace of mind for Jimmy's mom.

- If this patent portfolio is real and you assume the market's gonna keep growing, I could see it being that kind of worth as a strategic purchase to another buyer.

- This is one of those ones where the universe of people for whom this would be worth $300 million, there's probably a handful of companies.

- It's almost like, you know, it's defensible, right? So someone is going to copy it, right? If this market takes off, you're going to have lawsuits.

- I think there's so many interesting things we could do with this whole thing. We could raise money. We could even do something a little bit bigger. We could raise money from the listeners because people want to invest in the Worm Farm.

- The asking price, since you're sitting down, is $300 million.

- Okay, well, good news is I have a deal for today and there's no way we're buying it, but I think it'll be entertaining. We've already decided that? Okay. Well, wait till you see it. It came from a listener, so I think it'll be good.

- Sales were $16.2 million, and they earned $2.2 million, so they are asking just shy of 140 times earnings.
