ade, right? Correct. So how long does a process like that take you when you're going to create something from scratch? Or is it just some days it's one day, some days it's three months? It's hard to say. Do you have a consistent formula for creation? For songs, some days it can be three hours and some days it can be weeks because he's stuck on something. But for videos, I'll script something in like 20, 30 minutes and then he'll film himself for a few hours and then he'll edit for a few hours. Yeah, on average, I'm probably filming for one or two hours and then editing for one to three hours. And do they all have to be full songs or do you just do like, I make three verses and that's for this TikTok video, but I'm not turning it into a full song? Do you ever do that? No. Now we only will invest time in a TikTok if it can convert to streams or else that's just not lucrative for us. I have a brain fart. But yeah, for Ruffles, they only requested a 30-second demo. So for that one specifically, he only had to write 30 seconds of a song. Boom, done, easy. But normally, it's a full song, needs to be done or we won't post it. Because TikTok doesn't pay you for views. Yeah, but it does indirectly because let's say something goes viral, now your fan base grows, the next video you put out with a song, it's gonna pay. Oh, totally. But if the song is out, we can show you the charts, it'll be like, it's so much different if the song's out. Yeah, but I hear what you're saying. But I admire people who kind of like, there's a temptation. Anytime you're doing something new, because new stuff is so unproven, there's a tendency and a temptation to take the energy and the momentum from the new thing, but shift into the proven game. So for example, I did a comparison once of Joe Rogan's podcast, which is like an interview, talk show type of thing. And I compared it to the top, the Tonight show. And I was like, okay, I forgot who was the host or which show I did, but let's say Jimmy Fallon was the host of the show. And it's basically like, if you just compare across every key metric, so it's like audience size, Joe's podcast blows away Jimmy Fallon, and actually has for years and years and years. Once Joe got the Spotify deal, then it was like, it got kind of legitimized. But way before that, Joe was making a ton of money in a huge audience, like five years before that. But people didn't think of it like a business because they just didn't have a headline of $100 million a year to Spotify to latch on to. So audience size, Joe is bigger. Production, it's Joe's podcast, I think is Joe, Jamie, and like maybe one other person's like three or four people total to pull off that show. The Tonight Show has like 50 people behind the scenes just to like run one show. Like episodes per year, he has like more output with fewer people, bigger reach. And the only thing that was missing was like, it didn't have like a category that it fit into really, it was like, oh, it's a podcast. Okay, podcast, like is that a business? I don't really know, like, seems like there's a bunch of those. But Joe stuck with it. And like, he had a lot of offers to do other things, but he just stuck with it. Let it build, build, build, build, build. So that then by the time, you know, it got really, really big, he could promote whether it's his own product, like Onnit, or some other, you know, athletic greens or whatever, some product that pays him and start making ludicrous money. And Mr. Beast kind of does the same thing where like, he flirts with this idea of like, I could go create a Netflix show. But the reality is, if you talk to him, and you've seen him do what he's been doing over the last few years, it's just like, build audience, build audience through this, like, he's like, why would I leave YouTube? I can reach more people in the Super Bowl. And you're like, yeah, but it's different. But he's kind of not wrong. Like he is right. It seemed like this frivolous thing. And then now people see Mr. Beast is like kind of a business entrepreneur guy. But like, it's because of like, it's because he committed to this new lane like many years ago. And I guess what I would say for you guys is, it seems like you guys have a new lane of this kind of like, what I'm it's almost like fast fashion, but for music, which is like these tech talks that are hooky, and and catchy and skit based, and like they can get millions of views and build you a huge fan base. And I actually think if you just stay with that, and you don't try to be a traditional musician, you're going to end up way bigger than all the traditional musicians. If the problem is, it's just like a little bit unproven where that goes exactly. Or like, and it's very tempting to like take offers from legitimate brands and legitimate paths, as you've heard of. But the good news is you're making millions of dollars along the way you're making millions now. So at least it's at least you ain't broke. And we've talked to every major label. It's not like I, our friend Nick said that he's like, we're independent by choice, not by default. Because you'll see in the comments like, why hasn't anyone signed this kid yet someone signed Connor and I'm like, they've tried. We will not because that's not our goal. Our goal is to like do this ourselves do things the way we want to do it. And honestly, prove to other people that you can do it. Because I had no idea that this was possible. And I'd love for other people that are making music to know it too. How old are you guys? I'm 29 and Connor's 28. Wow. And early on, I remember you had this cool video with Courtney Cox. And then you had another one with what's his name? Idris. Yeah. Those are cool. Have you had any other like heroes or celebrities reach out that you that floored you? There's one guy I really look up to his name is Russ. He's a huge, yeah, he's a huge independent artist. He really kind of wrote the blueprint that I followed. If you want to talk to someone about independent touring, it would be Russ because I know Russ does it and he sells out massive like, if you want to talk about the financial part, the business part of touring, he'd be the one to talk to. His song Civil War gets me pumped up. Great song. Yeah, he's he's amazing. But yeah, Russ, Russ reached out. Yeah, so he like DM'd and showed love, which is just really cool because he's sort of been my North Star as far as just like how to do this independently. He wrote like, unsolicited advice, stay independent, you'll be making Ms like clockwork. And I'm like, that's all I needed to hear. Like, thanks, Russ. That was that was a really cool one for me. He only talks and raps too. That's amazing. His DMs are also raps. It's so hard because the DMs are so like Simu reached out. Yeah, he he's amazing. Yeah, I can't I'm like, you know, when people ask you a question on the spot and you're like, name a song and you're like, I don't know any songs. Yeah, there'll be random things where like, I'll notice on TikTok like, oh, Logan Paul like the video or T-Pain like the video like, you know, there'll be little things like that. That's cool. As far as like directly talking to someone, the big one that comes to mind is Russ just because he's someone who I'm trying to emulate as far as the business goes. I know you're in Vegas. Is it translating into off the screen stuff? You know, are you walking around downtown Vegas and people are coming up to you? Has that been happening? Yeah, that's been the weirdest part because like I said, we stay in our bubble and we hadn't been leaving the house much, especially during COVID. And then we went on a trip to Salt Lake City because we love Utah. It's so random, but we went there and it was a ton. And especially at the airport, like the TSA agents are always like, oh, my God, wait, like, look at his ID and then be like, the music guy. Like, we love your stuff. And I'm like, that's crazy. But the best is when little kids come up and they have their little, are you a YouTuber? And they're so cute. And it's like, hey, yeah, what's up? And we had like a five-year-old super fan come to Calgary to meet him at the rodeo. And Connor took him to Tim Hortons for donuts. But yeah, that's really cool because you get to see it translate in real life and especially when it's kids. And you're like, oh, that could have been like a core memory for that kid. That's really cool. Now that you are winning in one lane, what I've found is that when people are, let's say, winning and let's say that right now you're winning in like this content music game, you'll often see it's like kind of like Neo in the Matrix. You sort of see the game a little differently. You sort of see opportunities that, you know, like, oh, I feel like other people could be doing this in this other lane or we could do this, but, you know, we think that would work, but, you know, we just have our hands full, so we're not going to do it. But like, have you seen any, what I call adjacent opportunities for either content creators or on the business side? Like, have you, you've come from a business brain, right? So like, do you see other opportunities? I just had one the other day.
