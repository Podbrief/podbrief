On average, a million streams is around $4,000 USD on Spotify. And we're averaging like 60 million streams a month right now. So things are just pretty crazy. And I don't think most people know that there's that potential because in music, you hear there's no money in streaming. But I'm like, that's because labels own 80% of your songs. But if you own your songs, there's a shit ton of money in streaming. Okay, welcome first. So I don't know what the real intro of this is going to be, but I wanted to introduce this to you guys. Sam had put this on the calendar like, hey, we're recording with Connor and Brianna, and I think he knows you guys in person or in real life or whatever. And he kind of loosely said, he said something like, oh, I was like, is that the rapper kind of music person? And then when I was doing the prep for this, I was like, oh, it's these people. Oh, my God. I love your stuff. I am so excited for this, as you can probably tell because I'm screaming. But I'm so excited for this because I think what you do is literally amazing. I think it is so smart. And I think it is so impressive what you've done. You know, we've had the chance to talk to Mr. Beast on this podcast, and we've talked to Hasan Minhaj in the comedy world. We've talked to some Cody Co on the YouTube side, who you kind of look like. I think you know that. But I do. I got to say, I think you are playing TikTok like a fiddle. I think you have figured out the thing. Every platform that comes out, there's like the people that kind of come from the old world onto that and just kind of try to do the same thing, but maybe shorter or faster or video or whatever. And then there's people who figure out that medium for what it is. And I think you've figured out how to do music on TikTok like nobody else. I don't know if you're a marketing genius or if you fell into that, but either way, it's working. And therefore, I am so excited to have this conversation because last night, you could tell I'm kind of tired because I was binging your content. And I was just so inspired. I was so inspired. I don't do anything in the music world. I bet 99% of the listeners don't do anything in the music world. But I was so inspired just by what you were doing. So that's my intro of just fanboy because I can't believe how good you guys are at what you do. That was the nicest intro ever. Well, thank you so much. Yeah, no, as far as the marketing stuff goes, that's all Brianna, which is why it's so fun to be able to do this conversation with her because we do everything together. But so many of my ideas that have gone viral are her ideas. So let's give people a little context and we can either explain it or I do think it would be better to literally just show it. So I'm going to love the show. So I have a bunch that I liked. Do you know how much I like this? I was last night. So I'm doing this on my laptop and I'm not logged into TikTok. And I kept hitting the like button. And I was trying to like it. And it's like create an account. I almost created a second account just to give you the like because I was so I felt like you deserved it. Like, oh, thank you. Don't you feel like someone earned it? That's how I felt. I love it. Play a video. Play one of the videos. Yo, yo, yo, what is he doing? Oh, yes. He was telling me that if you if you cut a carrot a certain way, you can play it like a flute. He really thinks that's going to work. Apparently, it's a thing. Just ignore him. Ready? Uh, yeah. Do me a favor. Pull up that one session. Yeah, look, they said that I couldn't do it. So I went and did it. W's only, you know, I've been winning top of the world. The globe is spinning, spinning. If you know, you know, I've been on a mission. Mission. Okay, let's get it. Got a little time on my hands like a wristwatch. I don't got time for the breaks in the pit stop race to the gridlock. Take it like Chris Rock right to the chin. Still win heavy metals like Slipknot. Got the driving. I got tunnel vision. I just hit my stride the way I run the business. I've been making paper like I'm done to me. Let's see the end game. I got one division. Look, I don't ever bother with a critic. Hit him with a chronic color. So you create these, these little like opening skits and you, you don't hit them. Like, okay. Traditional way of doing things. Somebody wants to be a musician. They're going to fire up TikTok and they're going to just play their song. Maybe they play the song with a music video already baked in. And if it's me and I'm just hearing the opening of a song, it's usually pretty slow. There's a little bit of a buildup, you know, just like the, just a little bit of instrumental playing at the beginning. Or they might say, Hey, I'm Sean. This is my new track. Give it a listen. Right. Kind of boring, sort of begging for attention. Whereas you have these little opening skits that gets you curious of what's going to happen. You're playing all these characters like, you know, Eddie Murphy in whatever that movie was. You're Tyler Perry and you're playing all the characters. And then, then you hit them with a track that's actually like surprisingly good for how simple the intro is. I don't know how, how to explain it, but. This is how you got famous for doing this stuff on TikTok. Sure. Yeah. No. So I make music specifically in the kind of hip hop rap world, a little bit of pop sometimes. But yeah. So the whole goal with these videos is to not make it seem like you're selling someone, especially on TikTok. The moment you feel like someone's like, Hey, check out my song. You're going to swipe away. So you have to provide entertainment first. And we have found the best way to do that is through skits. It was really easy because Connor's been acting since he was six years old. So it was the perfect way to kind of merge those two worlds. And it, it worked. Yeah. I saw you were in a bunch of like, well, like good luck, Chuck, a bunch of movies. I started acting when I was six in Toronto, where I grew up, started with commercials. When I was 10, I did a movie called Cinderella Man. I played the son of Russell Crowe in that film. And that was kind of the first huge project that was ever a part of. First time I went to LA for the premiere, I signed with a US agent. And so from a kid, I've just been doing TV and film my whole life. And then when COVID hit and production shut down, I was like, what do we do? I was working at Alphapaw at the time, the pet company. I left that job. And then I was like, okay, Connor's really good at rapping. He's, he's loved hip hop for so many years. Why don't we try marketing that? And he didn't want to, because he thought TikTok was kind of lame. Like it was in the era where people just did those little dances. So I took some YouTube videos he had filmed, turned them into vertical pieces of content. He's like, I'm a thespian. I'm not going to be on TikTok. I'm an actor. I was naive. I make films. My biggest regret is not starting sooner on like social media specifically. I'd always been anti that. Once he saw a video go viral and then it translate to streams the next day, he's like, okay, maybe we can do TikTok. That changed everything. Yeah, every, every time. Let's pause for a sec. Yeah. We got to say the background here because people said Alphapaw. So basically, I am friends with Ramon who then became... Me, Sean and Ramon are all buddies. Ramon is on episode two or three or four. Sean talks to him. He had a pet... It's episode two. He had a soap opera company and then a pet company. I remember Ramon bought this pet business that seemed outlandish at the time, turned into a successful business. I went to Vegas to hang out with him. I think I was there regardless. And I just went to hang out to the office. Brianna was his right hand woman running marketing and everything else at the company. I go to this brand new office that he has. And Ramon's like, Connor is Brianna's wife. He's actually just going to help us move. He's trying to make it... By the way, Sam, Ramon told me that you showed up like high on drugs because you were afraid of flying. So you're like, you're like doped up. I hated flying. And I took up, I took too much medicine. And I got to, I like, I was still figuring out the dosage. And I got to the office. I was like, I got to go to sleep. So I was like all messed up. I was like, I'm sorry, guys. I'm like intoxicated. But I met, I remember meeting Connor. Connor was moving, yeah. He was moving boxes like you were because you were an actor. And you're in between shit. And you're just moving. And then like months later, Ramon was like, hey, remember Brianna's wife or husband? She, he's like trying to actually become a rapper. And he's actually good. And I'm like, the guy moving? What really? I don't buy it. I don't buy it. And then you had like some traditional rap music videos. And I'm like, OK, he actually is quite good. Then Ramon was like, hey, Brianna's actually left Alpha Paul. And she's going to take over his shit. And then I started seeing the TikToks. And I'm like, oh, my God, this guy's the best. And then you blew up. And now it looks like you have like 8 million monthly listens on your Spotify. He, Ramon's telling me that you guys are independent. Yeah. So you like own all the music. And he's like saying like, dude, their numbers for revenue are outlandish. You can say if you want or not. But like they're making a really good living. Now, Connor's going on tour. He's with Hoody Allen. He's in Europe. He's selling out shows in Europe. And now you're like legit famous. He looks like your top song. Spinnin' has 105 million downloads. The other one is 74 million. Like you guys are killing it. And I knew you just as this nice guy who was moving boxes. This was only I think this was three years ago. This wasn't long ago. Maybe four. You know what? The first time we met was at a comedy show five years ago in 2018. Do you remember that? It was like a Chris D'Elia show. And then, yeah, you came to the office. I think you and I were like butting heads that day. And then Ramon's like, oh, he's just on drugs. And I'm like, OK, that makes sense. Yeah. What Ramon told me. Yeah. Ramon sent a voice message to me last night. He's like, yeah, Sam came to the office. But he was like, you know, a little bit like doped up from the flight. And he goes, you know, Sam normally asks like pretty direct questions. Like add drugs. Oh, Sam was getting behind everyone's laptops. Like, what are you working on? Why are you doing it this way? And I'm like, I don't remember that. I don't remember that. Get out of here. You're making my team nervous as hell. And Brianna, you don't know this, but I also saw your work before we ever met because you were behind a lot of the ad. So Alphapaw scaled like crazy. So Ramon bought this business. That's a dog ramp business initially. So it was literally like it was called Sausage Dog. Sausage Dog. Oh, that's
