Welcome to another edition of Acquisitions Anonymous. I'm Heather Anderson, one of your co-hosts. Michael and I are looking at a really cool deal today. Slight valuation issue. You'll see it right away, I think. But something that you would be proud to own and we would actually like to buy it, but just slight discount on the asking price. So stay tuned and take a look. Thank you. Today's sponsor is Employer Flexible. And what Employer Flexible does is really function as a fractional HR department for your company or business. I've used them numerous times in putting together my companies. I've used them when I've bought companies. I've used them when I started from scratch. And basically when you're moving quickly or when you don't want to spend the time putting together your own HR department, benefits, all that kind of stuff, and you want to get the scale of being part of a larger group, you can reach out to Employer Flexible. And what Employer Flexible does is give you that buying power as if you're part of a bigger group and all that kind of stuff. And for me, I love working with them for numerous reasons. One is I know the owners and a lot of the staff and they've always treated me super good. And then the second thing is I hate HR. Like I don't enjoy it at all. And this way I can know it gets done right. I get the benefits of having a big, fully staffed HR department and the flexibility of having a vendor like Employer Flexible being there as a partner throughout my journey and making sure that everybody I work with is happy, taken care of, and we can focus on what really matters in our business, which is take care of our customers. So you can find their contact details, locations of their various offices, as well as more details on how they will help your business by going to employerflexible.com. And again, that's employerflexible.com. And thanks to them for sponsoring today's episode. Michael, how are you today? Good. I want to talk about our worm farm venture. So do I. I mean, that is exciting. Where are we on that? I don't know. Our point person for the worm farm decided not to jump to the recording today. So we need to get Mills on this, but he's like the busiest one of all of us. So I don't know if it's like, it was going to work. But. We're in suspense. So, okay. So two things about the worm farm. So for those of you just tuning in today, we've had a hugely popular episode on buying a worm farm in Northern California. As of this morning, a hundred thousand people on Twitter have interacted or viewed our post about the worm farm episode, which is enormous. But number two, I think, Heather, this, I think it would be some really good content if we actually bought one of these businesses. That's where I'm leaning towards. I think we need to go in together, be the board of directors for this thing. We could hire a general manager, CEO of the business, have them come in. I think it'd be really good. As Bill and I call it really good radio, like quote unquote radio, like good entertainment. I would be so excited for like every aspect of it for our listeners and for us. I mean, it's a really cool, interesting company. We, you know, we're excited about it. We just need to get the financials. I think now we're sort of commiserating with some of our listeners about how hard that can be sometimes. You know, just to get a package. Call us back. Come on. Well, okay. And to be clear, I'm advocating for it. We either do the worm farm or something like the worm farm, like the pizza boat. One of those things, I think we should actually do that. I think it'd be good radio. That's what I'm saying. I have an inside story on the pizza boat. Someone in my contacts is a neighbor of the guy that owns the hotel in front of the pizza boat. And he told me a little story about how the pizza boat guy had to end up paying the hotel to not get kicked off that, you know, that stretch of the water. Because he was cutting into the hotel's business a little bit, I guess. For those of you also tuning in and not caught up with this, we did an episode about the only boat selling pizza in the British Virgin Islands that was for sale. Bill wanted to fly down and buy it. Good stuff. Okay, so at least, I guess I got to pitch this idea to the other guys, but we all go in, we buy a small business, like that's what I think we should do. But it's gotta be entertaining. It's gotta be like Worm Farm or better. Yeah, I am so ready for this. Let's do it. Let's go. We can record the board meetings and turn them into episodes. We could use it for the CEO search. Like, I think there's so many interesting things we could do with this whole thing. We could raise money. We could even do something a little bit bigger. We could raise money from the listeners because people want to invest in the Worm Farm. They do, actually, yeah. Honestly, I think this could be very, very interesting for a lot of people. Okay, all right. So, well, good news is I have a deal for today and there's no way we're buying it, but I think it'll be entertaining. We've already decided that? Okay. Well, wait till you see it. It came from a listener, so I think it'll be good. Okay, so I'll go ahead and read it if that's all right with you. All right. Okay, so it is a new business listing. It is a 15-year-old brand in the sports and military protective gear segments. It has a massive IP portfolio of 100-plus patents, 40% repeat customer rate, and used by NFL, NBA, NHL, all these and different types of athletes. The asking price, are you sitting down, Heather? I am, I am. Yes, I know you are because I can see you on video. Can I stand? My dad, who is a lovely human being, whenever there was some sort of news to call, he'd be like, are you sitting down? Yeah, like I'm sitting, I'm right next to you. Anyway, okay, the asking price, since you're sitting down, is $300 million. Whoa, whoa. I don't think I've ever seen that asking price that high. That's why I love this episode. They're bold here, they're very bold. Yeah, you just gotta go with it. Sales were $16,205,000, and they earned $2.264 million, so $2.2 million. So they are asking just shy of 140 times earnings. Okay, that's a nice multiple, interesting. So the good news is if you buy this business and you don't grow it, it will take you 140 years to get your money back. That's my favorite math. I've said that to sellers before when they're like, okay, I want this. I'm like, okay, do you think your business is gonna grow? Nah, probably not. Okay, do you know it will take me 14 years to get all my money back? Do you know I'll be dead by then? So you say that to a seller, they don't think it's that funny. Michael, I hope you're not dead in 14 years, but this one, we would be dead for sure, yes. Well, that's very kind of you. I mean, the odds are stacked against me. I'm very large, you know, I'm six foot five. I'm left-handed. I have a history of some family health issues. So I'm trying hard, but there's a good chance, and I'm accident-prone. So like all those things are not in the way. They're not in the way. Okay, shoot. Did you know left-handed people die on average younger than right-handed people? I did not know that. Why? I mean, what's the reason? The theory that I've read, and usually we die like 12 to 15 months younger on average. The theory that I've read is because the world is designed for right-handed people. So we like keep getting ourselves caught in like combines. We're always messing, yeah. Using right-handed scissors the wrong way, and like, you know, stabbing ourselves. Okay, I buy it, but okay. So I'm short, and I'm right-handed. So apparently I've got good odds here, living a long time. Being a female helps also, if you guys live longer than us. And being female, that works too. Okay. Well, that was depressing. Okay, back to the listing. Website Closers presents a rare opportunity for an investor to acquire this 15-year-old premier company operating in the rapidly growing sports and military protected markets. Its extensive IP portfolio, established brand, and impeccable reputation make it capable of becoming the fourth largest multi-billion dollar sports company in the world. Their products are designed to protect people of all ages who are active in sports, as well as those in the military and law enforcement. The products are in high demand, but the company's limited capital has impeded sales growth. The company's proprietary and patented SKUs have generated several first-in-world products that boast a 40% repeat customer race and confirms its product's claims to protect and maintain customer satisfaction. The sports products are made for kids in youth sports, as well as adults playing amateur and professional sports who prioritize protection or will to pay a premium for tested, proven, and certified gear. Let's see, how much longer does this go? Oh my God, it keeps going. It keeps going, but I did notice that there's helmets for people playing pickleball in here somewhere. That was pretty surprising to me. We're gonna have to wear a helmet to play pickleball now, I guess. So one thing they do here, and I'll pull it up, they talk about, or they accidentally list the name of the company, and it is called unequal.com. So let me pull that up here. We could look at the website while we're looking at it. So it looks like- Yeah, very interesting. So we're pulling it up here. It looks like this guy has on some sort of, it's like body armor. We handle impact shock differently and better than typical plastics and foams. They use battlefield armor and cutting-edge materials like Kevlar, Acceleron, and Triter to disperse impact away from the head and body with over 100 patents, some of the finest military and police units trusted every day. So here they have lacrosse player pads, lacrosse player shirt. It looks like a lot of lacrosse stuff. Do they do other stuff besides that? Well, I was thinking helmets. I mean, so are people wearing these vests? I was thinking it was head protection. Yeah, they have a liner that goes inside of your helmet to keep you from- Oh, there it is. From getting a concussion, I assume. Let's see, helmet liners. Oh, here's their whole bunch of stuff. A bunch of different shirts, girdles, exoskeletons, insoles, padded sleeves, face shields, I think, is what this is. It looks like different- Interesting. That doesn't actually work. Their website doesn't work. Yeah, so it's a really interesting, like, anti-concussion. And then there's this idea of, I've never heard of this before. They fight against this Comotio Cordis. It's the number one killer in baseball, number two killer in youth sports, is a lethal disruption of the heart's rhythm that happens as a result of a sudden blow to the chest from a stick, ball, or hand. Oh, wow. Yeah, when people just get hit. Yeah, I've even heard about it happening in golf, if you get hit just at the right moment in the right place on your ches
