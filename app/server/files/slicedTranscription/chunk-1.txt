Welcome to ChangeLogin Friends, a weekly talk show about the Bubbaverse. Thank you to our sponsors for helping us bring you the best developer pods each and every week, Fassi.com, Fly.io, and Typesense.org. Okay, let's talk. Kick in whenever you guys want. Exedelic. That's how you pronounce it, Adam. I've got my copy right here. Very, very limited edition. I think there are only about 50 of those. Yeah, this was cool. I remember being like, this isn't even real, and I was like, wait, that makes it even more unique. Uncorrected bound manuscript. I gotta admit, John, as I'm reading it, I'm wondering, has he changed any of these prose? Because I wonder, how final is this copy you gave us? Because I was like, that's an interesting way to say it. I wonder if it's still in the ... And I keep asking myself that, but ... Well, obviously, you'll have to read it again, the final edition. Yeah. Are there any edits between this uncorrected bound manuscript and the official one that launches? There are, but they're not major ones. It's very, very lightly edited and polished, minor copy edits, but it's like 99% the same. Okay. Yeah. So we're talking, of course, about Exedelic, John's new book, Sci-Fi Craziness, that's how I describe it, in stores today, I guess. Well, congrats, John, you shipped a book to the world. That's cool. You made a thing. Thank you. It feels very weird and good to have it finally out there. And you shipped to us an uncorrected bound manuscript that we're talking about, maybe six months or so ago, and just as a nicety, you said, hey, we don't have to talk about the book, but figured you guys might like a copy. We do appreciate that, and we're happy to have you back on the show. So it's been a while. In fact, Adam, you have not met John previously, because I interviewed John a couple years ago about GitHub Arctic Code Vault, which I think, Adam, is an episode that you lined up. I coordinated that. Yeah, you coordinated it. I was so bummed. Yeah, I was like, jeez, I want to talk about the Svalbard Arctic Code Vault and all the fun things. Yes. Yes. So you made a contribution to humanity to some degree that the, for the moment, epicenter of open source code and a lot of the software contribution that's given to the world happens, archives it in this like insane idea. Like I think that's just kind of cool. And then hopefully when, you know, we're truly invaded, not just when the government says we're invaded or seemingly invaded, that, you know, humanity's gone, they can pull up the code that, you know, was just terrible. Right. For the most part. Like, doesn't everybody think that their passcode is terrible? That's why I say that. Oh, yeah. Yeah. That's what we did a video for, for YouTube. We had to look at a million views. And the most common comment was, please don't have included my hello world. Right. But no, no, we swept it all up. And I think there was some sort of threshold, right, of like what the contribution was to like warrant being included. Wasn't it something like that? Like it was a date? Was it just a date? Or was it like criteria? There was a date. But then there's also like a criteria. Yeah. Yeah. It had to have been active. Like you had to, either it had to have a certain number of stars or you had to have made some commit to it in the last year or two. But everything else we swept up, you know, for the future. Which as I mentioned years ago in an interview, Adam, is that our transcripts, which are marked down formatted plain text on GitHub, are in this Arctic code vault. So not only will our bad code be out there, but our bad questions and comments. Our bad words, yes. It's such a surreal thing to think about, isn't it, Jared? I'd like to think that at some point in the very near future, as we speak into these microphones, the words I'm literally saying right now are being transcribed into text, into Markdown, this Markdown repository you're talking about. And is in a GitHub repo that has, you know, infinite history, essentially, that you can go back to. Maybe you can, you know, scrub that history if you'd like to. But it's there. It's there, right? And then eventually it's somewhere else in the world. It's translated ideas. It's stuck in a vault somewhere or whatever, even. So I'm assuming that John and his team did a sufficient job with their archive strategy because, you know, forever is a long time in data archiving, isn't it, John? Oh, yeah. I mean, we were theoretically aiming for a thousand years, and when you start thinking a thousand years in the future, like, I have no idea anything happened. Like, there could be some sort of tragic event. We could go back to the Stone Age. We could have, like, uplifted ourselves to being AI gods or whatever by then. We really have no idea. We don't. But, you know, we sort of plan and hope that most eventualities will include Spawnport still being there. Yeah. Yeah. Well, one thing we can say about that particular aspect of your life, John, is it creates an excellent biography. So I was reading your little bio blurb on your book. I was thinking, like, you know, how do you introduce this guy? Who is he? What does he do? And, like, how many people can write this in their bio? The initial technical architect of bookshop.org and the founding director of the GitHub Archive program, preserving the world's open source software in a permafrost vault beneath an Arctic mountain for a thousand years. I mean, I can't write that in my bio, John. I'm never going to have that in my bio. That's so cool. I mean, I'm not going to lie. I kind of chuckled to myself as I wrote that. It's like, yeah, as you do. It was an extremely weird opportunity that doesn't come most people's ways. I'm very grateful for that, that one. And I think I did a reasonably good job. Yeah. I'm not going to downplay John by any means, Jared, but he also has something you don't have, too. And that you and I also get to share. What's that? The thing is that in our bio, we can say we produced the world's greatest podcast. Oh. All right. Well, I guess you can just say whatever you want in your bio. Is that your point? I'm pretty sure there's no bio police that comes along. It's my bio and I'll say what I want to. That's funny. So catch me up then, John, because we haven't spoken much. Obviously you've written a book in the meantime. You were an author prior. I remember us talking about some of the novels that you had written, what you are up to. But how do you go from that? I think 2020 was when it was all said and done, I believe, when it was all entered into. And then what have you done since then? You've just been writing this book. Have you taken up work elsewhere? What's your life been like? I have. Actually, this is kind of a segue from the Arca program to the book in that I was professionally thinking about the future of humanity, which somehow crystallized into me writing a weird science fiction novel about the future of humanity. But I have also, I took an engineering job because I'd kind of stopped coding as CTO and then program director. I hadn't written much good for a long time. You can see a big gap in my GitHub, sort of green visible map. So I took an engineering job at a company called Metaculous, which is extremely weird and science fictional itself. It's a platform for predicting the future. That's where I'm working now. So what am I going to say here in a second? A platform for predicting the future. Wow. Yeah, metaculous.com. What are you trying to predict? Well there are a huge variety of questions, like everything from the World Cup to are the robots going to kill us all? Everyone can create a question and then people go on and make predictions. And the theory is that enough people predict the future. Strangely, it seems, you know, studies show that our error is kind of cantilevered. So a group of people are actually much better at making predictions than any individual person, even if the individual person is an expert most of the time. Wow. Is it a marketplace? Like is it a place where you buy and sell predictions or place bets or what's the interaction like? No, it's just a pure prediction doing it for the love and the kudos. Oh, I see. It's a pure recognition. I mean, marketplaces have their place, but there's also like there's weird failure modes and people hedging and people betting against other people instead of against ideas. So yeah, there's a place for both of those. Which is fascinating stuff. I've looked a little bit into prediction markets and I've always been like, well, this is just gambling, but a very interesting form of gambling. Yeah. Yeah, that is interesting because people on podcasts make predictions all the time, you know, to come back home a little bit. Right. But it's always just one person and they're usually wrong. The easy button could be just to get whoever's involved in producing The Simpsons to just go on there. Yeah. I mean, that's kind of eerie, right? They clearly have a channel directly to the future. There was something with that. Like I'd seen a TikTok and I can't recall exactly, so I'm gonna paraphrase what I recall I think it said, was that they compared The Simpsons, I believe, to Star Trek, which both equally predicted some versions of the future. And I think there was something with like the amount of episodes versus the amount of episodes for each and the number of clearly correct predictions. Are you guys familiar with this? Before I go further, like... I have not seen it. Well, not so much the video, but the idea that they say The Simpsons have in many ways have just like potentially might be time travelers of sorts or have some version, some eye into the future because they predicted the future to almost the detail so many times that it's uncanny to think that they've, it's just, it's a phenomenon like that they've done it or it's not a phenomenon and they have access to knowledge of the future. So the other interpretation is that our future is so hilariously weird that comedians are better at predicting it than scientists. Right. I'm with that one. Like satire, given enough satire, right? Like eventually the future will map on top of that, some of that satire. I mean, the degree though, to which they've been accurate is the scary part. It's not so much roughly accurate. It's pretty much accurate in like several cases. And unfortunately I'm not such a scholar in The Simpsons that I've got this list that I could describe to you, but this is what I've heard. So this is secondhand knowledge to a degree, but I've heard of it and I believe the people, there's enough people that have verified this is accurate, that they've accurately predicted the future. I have definitely seen on Twitter or X or whatever colleague these days, people saying like, according to the prophecies of the second volume of The Simpsons and then some like eerie specific accurate thing that happened in 2021. Yeah. Well, I do think
