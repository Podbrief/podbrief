s from all those different sports. One or two uses it, puts an extra pad in their helmet or whatever, or wears the vest. Yeah, I think it's a great product. I think it's growth market, where definitely the idea of safety and certainly anything that is related to concussions is a big deal and you're gonna have growth. But I can't believe that these products are all that unique. And even the patents aren't all that unique. Like I said, you could create something very similar, but slightly different and get your own patent. Compete. It doesn't say where this is manufactured, does it? I did not see that. I'm assuming. Yeah, it doesn't say USA. So I'm assuming that means it's Asia or somewhere overseas. It says here the company typically maintains a six to 12 month inventory supply and orders replenishment products as needed. That would tend to indicate these are contract manufactured someplace overseas. Yep, somewhere. They put them here in a 16,000 square foot warehouse, which is not that big for 27 million. No. So this is a small company. It's got a unique product, probably a really cool seller that's into developing and inventing things. That's great. I just, I don't know where they're coming up with that price. And like, let's just say they came to a regular multiple on a 2.2, then it might be a nice company. Then there might be something interesting. I mean, you'd have to do a lot of marketing to kind of, you know, grow and maintain your position. I don't know, what multiple would you pay for something like this, Michael? I would be, it depends on how much they've been growing so far, that would affect my opinion on it. But let's say they've been growing just five to 10% per year. I would be excited to own this business at five to six X, even though. Yeah, right. I think that's, I think that's much more of a realistic investment thesis here. You know, this business is in a nice niche. It has this patent portfolio. You have a lot of pricing power and a very clear path to how you get to your target market, right? This is your, you go to Facebook, Instagram, you sell ads and you try to target moms who are terrified that little Jimmy is gonna get a concussion when he's playing lacrosse, right? And you, and she's willing to pay whatever it is to feel better about Jimmy playing lacrosse. And so I think that gives you something awesome in terms of owning this business is, you are not selling athletic equipment. You're in the business of selling peace of mind for Jimmy's mom. And I think that is just a great business to be in and gives you tons of margin to be able to raise prices and be able to hammer in on that specific niche and really own it. And that's why I'm saying like, I would, this would be a screaming deal for me at that five to six X because I think you have tons of pricing power. I think you've got a lot of runway to grow. I think it's a great place to be in. And that's making the assumption that this patent portfolio is probably just BS. That's how I see most patent portfolios turn into. They're mostly BS if you're trying to build an entire business around them. So anyway, I don't know, what do you think? I agree with you. And I would really wanna know how fast it's grown. It's been around 15 years. So I don't think it's grown that fast. I think most of those 15 years, I mean, that's a lot of patents every year in 15 years. So I think they've just been putting most of their efforts into that and less so into marketing and finding their market, although the market has sort of found them. So they've got a good effective product. And I would be happy to own something like this too, right? But in your cocktail party test, this one would feel really good, right? You'd come in and say, I protect children and athletes from concussions and what does that commode? I can't say it. Yeah, the heart stopping. Your heart stopping, the heart stopping thing. I mean, yeah, it would feel great. And that would be, it's kind of a mission driven almost business that someone could feel just fantastic about owning. It's just not, it's a six multiple at the most. That's where it feels like a great deal and something to own. And then there's a big, for me, there's a big asterisk. If this patent portfolio is real and you assume the market's gonna keep growing, I could see it being that kind of, worth it as a strategic purchase to another buyer, but as an individual investor, like it just doesn't make, that's too big of a bet to make. And as a non-strategic, so let's say Under Armour or Nike comes in and tries to buy something like this, they have a huge distribution advantage. They can leverage, they can try to explore that niche, but I don't know. Usually those guys are pretty smart. Usually by now they've already looked at something like this and figured out it's not worth anywhere near $300 million or it's not strategic to them at all and that's not a space they wanna be in. So anyway, that's why it kinda doesn't make sense to me in terms of the story of how they got to this place. Right, because you're buying it in addition to your helmet. You're not buying it with your helmet. I don't know. It is someone that goes, like I agree with you. You're going out of your way to have peace of mind and feel like you've done everything you can to protect either your child or yourself, which is great. Didn't talk much about the military side of it. Now you're looking at that. Yeah, it's kinda hidden in their website. I don't know how big of a business it is for them. They only have three, which is kind of a lightweight body shield, some sort of plasticky thing, and then a thing that like fits on their, some sort of helmet-y type thing that fits under a baseball cap. It's like an under baseball cap helmet. That's pretty cool. Yeah, that's pretty cool. I could probably use that when I'm around my teenagers. Um, so. Well, that's a growth market potentially, but you know, selling to law enforcement is also really usually a very long sales cycle. That's awful. And it kind of requires an insider, yeah. That's awful. Those are not easy, yeah. All right, well look, I think it sounds like we would love to own this business as an e-commerce business, not as a $300 million venture play on an IP portfolio. Um, and if something were to change where they come down by say $285 million on their price, we could probably, we'd be interested in, it might be a good deal. We could do this and a worm farm. Yeah, we could do both, ooh. You know, one-time sales, I think I would get much more excited about this, but this is something I wouldn't even really even start talking to somebody when they have this kind of, it's clear they're looking for a buyer who's not me. That's totally fine. If they can get it, they can get it.
