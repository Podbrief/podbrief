lk to someone about independent touring, it would be Russ because I know Russ does it and he sells out massive like, if you want to talk about the financial part, the business part of touring, he'd be the one to talk to. His song Civil War gets me pumped up. Great song. Yeah, he's he's amazing. But yeah, Russ, Russ reached out. Yeah, so he like DM'd and showed love, which is just really cool because he's sort of been my North Star as far as just like how to do this independently. He wrote like, unsolicited advice, stay independent, you'll be making Ms like clockwork. And I'm like, that's all I needed to hear. Like, thanks, Russ. That was that was a really cool one for me. He only talks and raps too. That's amazing. His DMs are also raps. It's so hard because the DMs are so like Simu reached out. Yeah, he he's amazing. Yeah, I can't I'm like, you know, when people ask you a question on the spot and you're like, name a song and you're like, I don't know any songs. Yeah, there'll be random things where like, I'll notice on TikTok like, oh, Logan Paul like the video or T-Pain like the video like, you know, there'll be little things like that. That's cool. As far as like directly talking to someone, the big one that comes to mind is Russ just because he's someone who I'm trying to emulate as far as the business goes. I know you're in Vegas. Is it translating into off the screen stuff? You know, are you walking around downtown Vegas and people are coming up to you? Has that been happening? Yeah, that's been the weirdest part because like I said, we stay in our bubble and we hadn't been leaving the house much, especially during COVID. And then we went on a trip to Salt Lake City because we love Utah. It's so random, but we went there and it was a ton. And especially at the airport, like the TSA agents are always like, oh, my God, wait, like, look at his ID and then be like, the music guy. Like, we love your stuff. And I'm like, that's crazy. But the best is when little kids come up and they have their little, are you a YouTuber? And they're so cute. And it's like, hey, yeah, what's up? And we had like a five-year-old super fan come to Calgary to meet him at the rodeo. And Connor took him to Tim Hortons for donuts. But yeah, that's really cool because you get to see it translate in real life and especially when it's kids. And you're like, oh, that could have been like a core memory for that kid. That's really cool. Now that you are winning in one lane, what I've found is that when people are, let's say, winning and let's say that right now you're winning in like this content music game, you'll often see it's like kind of like Neo in the Matrix. You sort of see the game a little differently. You sort of see opportunities that, you know, like, oh, I feel like other people could be doing this in this other lane or we could do this, but, you know, we think that would work, but, you know, we just have our hands full, so we're not going to do it. But like, have you seen any, what I call adjacent opportunities for either content creators or on the business side? Like, have you, you've come from a business brain, right? So like, do you see other opportunities? I just had one the other day.
