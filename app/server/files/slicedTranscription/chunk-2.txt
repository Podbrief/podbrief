the law of large numbers comes into effect here. And the fact that they have 20 seasons, more than 20 years, they have, I think over 750 episodes. And then if you think, okay, per episode, how many quote unquote predictions of events will there be per episode, hundreds of things they come up with in a 22 minute time period that could be true in some sort of distant future. So that's just large numbers. And I think if you have enough numbers, you're going to hit on a few and it's better than Nostradamus because his stuff is all very vague and like interpretable, but at least with The Simpsons, it's like, like you said, Adam, it is like very specific thing that happens. And it's not like an interpretation of the thing. It's like, no, that's literally what happened or it's off by a skew. So it is pretty impressive, but it is just like, what's impressive to me is they're large numbers. I mean, it's amazing. Yeah. The ability to sustain for that long. The most distinct one they had though was Trump coming down the escalator, being president. Like that was, nobody predicted that really. And that was like the meme. It was a predicted meme essentially, and it turned into a meme, but it was predicted. Yeah. If you go back to like Jesse, the body of Ventura became governor of, was it Minnesota? And then you're thinking like, well, what's more absurd than that? Well, it's like Donald Trump is president, right? Like that's a trend line perhaps. And then you go there. There's a bit, I don't know if you've gotten to it in the Exodella, the book where people go, the protagonist goes back in time to 2003. And he's like, I think I remember the future, but it's a future in which Arnold Schwarzenegger is governor and Donald Trump is president. Is that a real future? Am I elucidating this? This doesn't seem very likely when I think about it. Right? Yeah. Well, I haven't gotten far enough I guess, because I haven't hit that bit. So you're spoiling it on me. Apologies. It's relatively early. I mean, so far in my experience in this book, and I'm not super far into it, it's just like craziness begets craziness. I'm where I feel like I am is in the first third of the matrix, you know, before we figure out what the plot actually is. And you're just kind of along for a ride and you're wondering when's it all going to make sense. But I also read the quote on the back, the review of the Lisa's version, and it sounds like maybe it never makes sense. Like it's truly great, but it's just truly weird and it never gets less weird is what one of the quotes on the back says. So I promise you it all makes sense at the end. Actually, that quote does say it all makes sense in the end, by the way. All right, good. I don't want to mischaracterize. I haven't got to the part that makes sense yet, but I'm sure it all will. In addition to this, you've been working on some nonfiction, you said some writing about our weird past and maybe what it's going to be for our weird future. You want to talk about some what you call a cultural history of AI doom. I love to hear your thoughts on this. There's like 1990s mailing lists. It opens up into lots of subcategories. Where do we go here, John? Totally. I mean, I guess we can start with like, so what is generally sort of the very first science fiction novel was actually a novel of AI doom, believe it or not. Really? Yeah. So this goes back to the early 1800s, right? There's a giant volcanic explosion in Indonesia, 1815. 1816, the weather is terrible across their own hemisphere. You know, there's drought, crops fail. And a bunch of people at this mansion in Switzerland, extremely rich and privileged and weird people, have a terrible holiday. This includes Lord Byron, who's like the Kanye West of his day, super controversial. His daughter grew up to be the world's first computer programmer, Ada. Percy Shelley, whose poem, Ozymandias, he probably read in high school. Anyways, Byron challenges them all to write a scary story. And the most culturally significant person who gets this challenge is Shelley's 19-year-old girlfriend, Mary Godwin, who writes Frankenstein as a result. And everyone knows Frankenstein, right? Like the guy with the bolt in his neck sort of shambling along going, uh, kill. He's in the house. He's upstairs. That's not actually how the book works, though. In the book, Frankenstein is this brilliant creature that teaches itself to read, teaches itself languages, invents new things. It is basically an artificial general intelligence that the other characters are concerned is going to reproduce and take over the world. So, like, the early 1800s, we are already worried about AGI and AI doom and the robots killing us all. What? Yes, that is correct. Was he a monster, though, or a robot? What was he in the book? He was like an artificial creature created, you know, stitched together from other parts. So not a robot as we understood it, but I mean, we barely had science back then. Right. Well, the famous phrase, it's alive, came from Dr. Frankenstein. Of course, yeah. Screaming it, of course. I'm not going to, I can't if you want me to. I can scream that. Please. Please do. We're here for it. Yeah. Okay. It's alive. It's alive. Okay. I was waiting for the second one to drop. Yeah. That was good. Well, he, yeah, he crescendos with it. Right. I think he says it twice. Yeah, he does. I mean, he's excited. Right. He stitched together body parts, electrified it to some degree. I'm not, I know the story. I'm not like specific on the details, but I think he stitched together and electrified it. And that was kind of like the thing. And we are electrochemical beings. So that makes sense that you would initiate life through power, electricity, you know? Yeah. And this was just the era of the 1800s where they're just freaking it out, right? Electrifying frogs legs and saying that they twitched when you ran a current through them. They were totally freaked out by that. Yeah. Totally. Yeah. There's, man, this is such a weird space, man. Between electricity and sound. Have you heard of like the stuff around like sound even? There's a lot of interesting stuff around sound, but you can produce sound waves and like make shapes and make all these things. And that's how they suggest that they use some sound technology to move the, with accuracy, all the stones to the pyramids in place. Like it would have taken, they had like a small margin of window to do certain things. And between electricity and any things you could do with that and sound, kind of like modern stone age, because we don't know at all how that works. And so many of us are just removed from the science of this stuff that it seems science fiction, but it's quite possible. Have you heard about ultrasound drug delivery? This is kind of a new thing. No. Ultrasound drug delivery. No, it's kind of amazing. So if they want to deliver drugs to your brain, right? Like it's hard to get drugs into the brain. There's the whole blood brain barrier. Yeah, you can't. Yeah. Right. So their solution is just to inject you with all these tiny, tiny little bubbles that go everywhere in your body. And then if you apply the right frequency of ultrasound, then the bubbles break and the drug inside them gets released out. So you can very specifically micro-target drug delivery anywhere in the body now. This is a relatively new thing. So you put the drug into a bubble, in multiple bubbles, and you distribute the bubbles to different areas of your body and then you make the bubbles pop? That's correct. That sounds amazingly weird. How do you target which bubbles should pop? I don't know. I have so many questions. You just give an area. You like aim the ultrasound at a particular area. You can... Oh, I see. You target with the sound waves directly into that area. Exactly. So the bubbles would spread everywhere, even to your brain, and then you put the sound waves into your brain and it pops right there? Precisely. That's brilliant. That's interesting because, I mean, there is an ultrasound that women get when they're pregnant and they have a child, they get an ultrasound to look at the baby. It's kind of the same thing, right? Like it's sending a sound or some sort of thing that makes an image based upon... I don't know how ultrasounds work. I'm just like roughing it based upon what you just described. This is fun, Adam. Please keep guessing. But it is... The word ultrasound is in there. So I'm assuming they're connected. Yes. And it's plausible. I assume the bubble popping ultrasound is a higher energy, but I could be wrong on it actually, no. I mean, I don't have the ability to pull up my personal archive here of what this thing is called. And I'm going to be so upset later, but this sound stuff is legitimate. Like they do some really unique things with sound. Like when you pay attention to that spectrum of people uncovering this knowledge and this experimentation, it's just, you cannot... It's like science fiction. It's so wild what's possible with sound. So the other thing I've heard about ultrasound is people are speculating, like, you know, you get an ultrasound image and it's very hazy and you need an expert to interpret it. But they're talking about if you can get an AI to clean that up and turn it into like something, you know, movie quality, everyone could have their own personal ultrasound. And if you're like, oh, I feel weird today, I think I'll inspect the inside of my body by aiming the ultrasound there, having the AI show me exactly what's going on to see if there's anything weird going on, which is a little disturbing, honestly, if you're not in the medical profession, but like within the bounds of possibility. Well, according to Egypt forward.org, a study shows that ancient Egyptians used sound waves in building pyramids. So if that headline is anything to be believed, then Adam's sentence is also something to be believed. I mean, I'm sure they shouted at each other a lot. I mean, that's how work gets done, isn't it? We use sound waves all the time to get work done around here. No, man, the Sphinx goes over there. Look at the place. They said that the window to which they had to construct these pyramids to do it in the timeframe that they suggest they did it, where they had to cut and move these large blocks. I don't know if they're granite or what the heck they're made of, sandstone or something just unimaginable. They're just so big. The degree of accuracy of the cuts when they had to move them into place and construct these things, the margin of error was within like minutes. So the accuracy to which they built them in the time they suggest they built them is just you have to think like how in the world could they do it? Because like even in modern technology, we cannot replicate how to build such constructions. Like it just hasn't been done. We couldn't build the pyramids of Giza today. Is that what you're saying? We couldn't build them? Lik
