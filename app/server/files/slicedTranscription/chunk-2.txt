t. It can happen. Because there's electricity running your heart. And if that little thing gets knocked out of whack, you're in trouble. Interesting. It is extremely rare, though. So it's kind of interesting. Would you wear a vest for that? Because the chances are so low, but interesting. So it seems like it's mostly, like, foam padding that can be put in different parts, you know, on a vest, in a helmet, different places. And it's got some kind of patents, obviously a lot of patents, to, you know, it's very specialized, obviously, the way this foam is made. 100%. Well, and this is great. This is something to like here, is we're not, they're not selling increased performance for kids, which I think is a very crowded space. This is about like, hey, you're sending your kid out to play lacrosse or soccer or baseball or football, like, you know, how much is your kid's safety and health worth for you as a parent? And like, it's a lot. Yeah, right. Now, the patents, I think, is where they must be coming up with the idea of this valuation. This is my, I'm guessing, because they say they have over 100 patents. That seems like a lot of patents to me. You know, I've recently talked with someone who is in the business of ensuring trade secrets, which is sort of like a step below. You don't get something patented. And they were explaining to me why a lot of companies are getting away from getting patents, because when you get them, the information all becomes public and it becomes very easy for someone to kind of rip off your idea and just make something slightly different than that. So I don't know that, you know, I don't know that these patents are certainly not worth a 300 million, I can't imagine, but I'm just trying to guess at where they came up with that number. And I'm thinking that they think there's that value in the patents. It seems like it. I mean, the way they talk about here, and I'll read here on the listing, the company's intellectual property is a significant achievement. They have patents on these proprietary products in 24 countries, with their patent portfolio valued at 322 million. Google, parenthesis, Google purchased Motorola for 12.5 billion to acquire its thousands of phone-related patents that enabled Google to launch its phone dynasty. The company's extensive patent portfolio on sport and military protection will give the buyer a commanding presence and distinct advantage in these markets. The brand has gotten recognition for products designed to offer protection from the Commodio, Cordis, and so on. So I think, I mean, if I'm understanding what the broker is saying here, they're saying you're not really buying an e-commerce business here. You're buying a set of patents that they've produced through their research, and you're betting that uptake on these type of things is going to grow as more and more, there's more and more mandates for safety, more and more parents are interested in it. And here they talk about, like, there's a leading UK soccer team that has mandated all members wear head protection. And European soccer leagues are considering mandating head protection league-wide, which will open a potential market of 100 million players that would be required to wear rated, certified head protection for which the company is well-known. All right, taking a quick pause here. I have something to tell you. This is Michael. I hate bookkeeping. I hate bookkeeping, I hate doing HR, I hate doing all that kind of stuff.

So give Charlie a call, cloudbookkeeping.com. And now, back to the episode. And it looks like the head protection for soccer was, they showed it in some of the photos, looks kind of like a headband, like a sweatband, but it's thicker. And so it's not a helmet. They're not saying that the soccer players are gonna be wearing a full helmet, but it looks like there's this padded sort of headband, which makes sense. I'm sure it adds a lot of protection. There they are. I remember when I was a kid and I would do headers and I would totally feel like my bell had been rung multiple times. Yeah, I'm sure it was. I mean, honestly, my son played soccer and those could be brutal, those headers. And sometimes just crashing into each other, not seeing that the other person was coming at you. So I think that's, there's probably a lot of growth, but I mean, 140 years worth of, I don't know. Why haven't they grown it? They've had the company 15 years. Sounds like they've, with over a hundred patents, it sounds like the sellers are really into developing, just developing new products and getting them patented, but they're maybe not, maybe they didn't focus a lot on the growth. But nonetheless, it's still only at 2.2 million EBITDA, you know? Right. I, yeah. Valuation's obviously just not realistic, unless there's some company out there that is doing something similar and these patents are just the thing they need to take off. Yeah. That's the only thing I can imagine. You're betting there is going to, the only way this, I guess, makes anything close to sense is you're betting that this becomes a huge market that somebody has to have. But it's, you know, unlike cell phones, which at the time, I think they list the parallel there where Google bought Motorola for patents. And I think that was in 2013, 2014. Like cell phones were already enormous. Like it was pretty clear how that was going to be worth $12 billion. But here you have this situation where it's like, okay, well, this is hopefully an emerging market because there's another solution to concussions from soccer, from headers. You just don't do headers. That's what- Oh, that was a thought. Well, in some soccer leagues, like kids' soccer leagues, you're not allowed to do headers. I think that makes sense, to be honest. It is kind of a strange, you know, it's soccer. It's all about the feet and all of a sudden they're crashing heads. Now, I'm going back to my earlier comment. Isn't it, couldn't someone else develop similar, you know, padding? You know, is there something so special that this is the only padding that anybody would buy? This is what's going to be adopted across all these markets or couldn't someone else develop something making these patents not that worthwhile? I mean, it is just padding. I don't know, you know, I'm not an expert here, but I feel like someone else could come along and make something pretty similar. Yeah. Well, there's- For less than 300 million, is my point. 100%. There is this question of, as you would look at this business, your due diligence would have a heck of a lot of visibility into what the patent portfolio actually looks like. And I think that's what they're saying the whole thing. They're saying the whole thing is, you know, this is a highly defensible patent portfolio and that is the fundamental bet you'd be making here, right? Like, can you, you know, A, is this going to be a big market in the future? And then B, like, what happens when you try to go defend against competitors using your patent portfolio? And I think those are the two big questions. And I think one, yeah, you could imagine that this becomes a multi-billion dollar industry if, you know, given the trajectory of how we're going on protecting kids and investing to do that. The patent portfolio is a big question mark to me and something you would have to go dig into to understand. Yeah, and I mean, it's almost like, you know, it's defensible, right? So someone is going to copy it, right? If this market takes off, you're going to have lawsuits. I don't know. That's just, it's a lot of gambles here. A lot of them. Can we talk about the other, like, red flag? Like, why is a company with a $300 million list price on WebsiteClosers.com? I mean, usually, WebsiteClosers is one of my favorite. They write great teasers, which is why we do them a lot. But like, they're known for like, you know, a portfolio of like, what's it called? The people doing astrology, right? Or like, crossword puzzle websites, right? Like, that's what I expect from Website Closers. And it's like, oh no, no, hey, we're this like, very niche IP portfolio that has been somewhat monetized, and it's $300 million, so. I don't think the buyer of something like this is going to be looking here. That's for one. Yeah, and I have a feeling this broker probably thought, oh, 2.2 million of EBITDA, okay, that's in my lane. I can do that. And then, you know, upon discussion, you know, the seller names their price about all this IP, and it's 300 million, and he's just putting it out there. That's my impression. This is one of those ones where the universe of people for whom this would be worth $300 million, there's probably a handful of companies, you know, potentially. And it's like. And they probably already have a similar product, right? Don't they? Maybe. Patting, at least, right? Of some kind. Maybe, yeah. And it's like, well, why is this publicly listed? Like, you know who they are. Like, call them all. It's like, it's just a, it just doesn't make much sense. Except for helping us record like an awesome episode, which I'm totally cool with, so. Yeah. It is used by NFL, you know, all the big sporting leagues. Okay, so, oh, I'm sorry to interrupt you. That's important to, I want to make sure I articulate what it says very clearly, because it's not actually used by the sporting leagues. It's used by NFL, MLB, NHL, NBA, FIFA, Big Ten, SEC, and Olympic athletes. The athlete word is very important. That means they just have one person there who's a customer. It is not an NFL. There's nothing in here that does anything to say that it's officially sanctioned by any of those leagues. But this broker did a really smart thing, which is say something technically correct, but easily misinterpreted to indicate that, oh, this is like used by the SEC and mandated by them. Like, this would be great. But that does not appear to be the case. Well, I fell for it, Steve. Look, I was all impressed. And you're right. I was trying to figure that out. It's such a small company. How can they be selling? You're right. It's the athlete
