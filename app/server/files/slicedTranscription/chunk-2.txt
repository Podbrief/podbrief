 right. Wow. Which is also what they used to call my dorm in college. But so well played. So then it's like little dogs use the ramp to get up on the bed or on the couch or down from the couch. I have four of them in my house because I got a little dog. And I also know Ramon. So he sent me four free ramps. So these ramps are great. But I was like, how do you sell these? Like, are people looking for these? He's like, no, most people don't even realize they want it. So we got to make ads that teach them that they want it. And I was just getting into e-com. Ramon's the reason I started an e-com brand because I was sitting at his house hearing the Shopify on his phone. I was like, dude, I want that noise in my life. How do you do that? So I decided to start one. And to help me, he goes, he's like here, I added you to my ads account, which is like basically like adding you as a cosigner on a bank account. Basically, nobody gives their Facebook ad account to somebody else. But that's very intimate. Ramon is that kind of guy, that kind of friend. And so I'm in the ad account, and I'm looking at all your ads that you created because you had all these video ads that were working to sell pads and ramps and all this stuff. And I was like, damn, I need somebody who's good at creating ads. And I think, is it right that you were just kind of like at that warehouse or you would just like come up with the concept yourself and figure out like test them? Is that kind of where you got this like quick video production? Like you and your sister, I think. It was mainly myself and Catherine. Do you remember Catherine? Catherine and I ran the marketing, and then my little sister would help me. But basically, we would just try and like either pull at someone's heartstrings, like we would start a video with maybe an injured dog, and then instantly a person that has an injured dog can relate to that. And they're like, oh, like, and then we show the solution. And then a cute little dog. We literally bought a chihuahua. She's upstairs just to use like for marketing ads. And we would show her trying to jump up on the couch. And instantly, everyone that has a chihuahua is like, oh, my dog does the same thing. Boom. Here's a solution. And it just freaking worked. It was wild. Like I couldn't believe it. We went from an office as big as a bathroom to like a 20,000 square foot warehouse within a year. Yeah, I was doing a lot of moving. Connor was moving a lot. Connor would help film. He would help edit the ads. Yeah, it was a family production. And then all the high performing ads we filmed in either our living room or Chloe's living room. Yeah, in our house. And then when I was like, okay, I really want to do my own thing. We want to start a family. I need to leave this pet company. It broke my heart because Ramon's my best friend, but I had to ultimately leave. And I was trying to start other companies. I'm like, what can I start? I started like a coffee brand, like a Christian brand. And then our friend Cliff Weitzman, he's the CEO of Speechify. Oh, we know Cliff. You know, I love Cliff. He says hello. I was talking to him this morning. I said I was going to be on. Yeah, Cliff was over for dinner and I was just venting my frustrations of product boredom. And he's like, Bree, stop. Like, this is your product. He's like, Kris Jenner, the shit out of him. So the next day I stopped. I had a huge order, an inventory of coffee, and I let it go to waste. And I'm like, we're going all in on this. And I pretty much just used the same mindset I used to sell the dog ramps to sell his music. It's like, how can we hook someone in? And how can we tell a story around this song? Because a lot of music these days is just like a really cool beat and like some generic lyrics. Right. But I'm like, there's a lack of storytelling. And I think that's what music online is missing. And we did it. So and we're doing it independently. So. So you can see it because as I was doing my binge, I can't even call it research. I was just enjoying myself going down, did the Tour de France down your profile. The first video actually on your YouTube channel is pretty dope. I don't know. Sam, have you seen the very first video that the first song that he posted? Yes. Is that is that the one where you rap about how you? Yes. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yes. Yeah, yeah, yeah. What is it called? The S word or what did you say? What'd you call it? It's just S, just the letter S. So you rap about how you used to have a stutter. And then in the song, you're basically every like a bunch of the words start with S. And by the way, you sent me down a Watsky rabbit hole to last night. We love Watsky. Huge, huge inspiration for that. I've never heard of him. He's dope. So anyways, that's the first song. And it's like, OK, this person clearly has talent, but also it's like, I don't know. That's different. Yeah. It's never been easier to go on, I don't know, Fruit Loops and make a beat and then try to try to rap and like do 15 seconds of a good rap. Like that's, I guess, never been easier. Would you say like it's kind of more competitive than ever to do that part? Totally, totally. I mean, there's what, 60,000 songs uploaded every day. I think the data is closer to 100 now, but roughly, I'd say to be safe, 60,000 songs uploaded every day. Yeah, the ease of being able to make music now, especially in the hip hop space with programs like Fruity Loops. And Splice, where you can find samples that are royalty free. Yeah, a lot of people are making music way more efficiently than ever. You can see like kind of the progression, like, OK, you're getting some views, putting out some good tracks. But like there was, I could almost draw a line and be like, then they figured out how to create like hooks for these videos. Yeah, it was the presentation. And then everything was different after that. Is that when you joined, Brianna? Like, is that kind of when you Kris Jennered the shit out of him? Yeah, that's when I really stopped trying to do a million things and focused just on him. And the biggest moment for us was creating a series. That's when we started the Spin the Globe series, where he would spin a globe and land on a country and collab with an artist. That took us from like here to like... Yeah, that took off like crazy. That first video that we did, where we landed on Zambia and found the Zambian artist, that video has 72 million views on TikTok and 72 million views on YouTube Shorts. So explain that video. Yes. Yeah, so it was an idea where I had this song with this artist named Killa, who's this independent artist from Zambia. When we first worked with him, he had less than a thousand monthly listeners. He had 189 monthly listeners. And now he's over a million because of that song, which is incredible. Wow. And it's like changed his life. But essentially, we were like, all right, how can we market this? And I was like, all right, we need a strong hook in the first two to three seconds. Hold on, let me play it. I want you to break it down. Sure. No, please do. Yeah, yeah, yeah. All right, I'm going to spin this globe and wherever my finger lands, I'm going to find an artist from that country to collaborate with me on a song. Let's see what happens. Zambia. All right, well, let's find out more about Zambia. I started researching some up and coming artists and one guy really stood out to me. His name is Killa. He's a rapper from Lusaka, which is the capital of Zambia. I felt like his style and his voice would sound perfect on the song I'm working on. So I reached out to him. I sent him the beat. And then a few days later, he sent me back. So that whole thing, five seconds there, like the speed that you hit them with that initial hook. You're already started. You're like mid word. You're like, all right, I'm going to spin this globe. Now you're doing something interesting visually. And then you set up the premise, the stakes of like, wherever my finger lands, I'm going to find an artist and do a song with them, which, OK, I've never heard of that before. So where does this idea come from? And like, how much time did you put into that first, getting that first five seconds to be good? I was literally at the gym with Connor's mom. And I thought of it and I texted him. I said, I'm stopping at Target. We're grabbing a globe. Here's the idea. And his mom parked the car. I ran and got it. It was like 19 bucks. And to be honest, at the time, we didn't realize it would blow up. And we posted on a Sunday and it got three million views the same day. And I'm like, oh, shit. OK, this is a series. We have to do this again. And instantly I went on my phone. I'm like, what country's next? And I searched hashtag Dutch rap because I really wanted a Dutch artist. I think that language is so beautiful. And I found this guy named Benz. Then we did episode two, two weeks later. And boom, that's spinning. And that's the song that now has over 100 million streams on Spotify in less than nine months. That's so insane. That's it is insane. Yeah. So that first one that that that you were just playing, it really was just like, OK, how do we make content around the song? What's the content of a moment for something visual? What's something visual we can do? Right. So for spinning like the other one, you played with the carrot flute. It was that idea of like, all right, this flute is such a strong element of the song. I remember watching a video back in the day where someone made it. No, no, no, no, no. Christian, our brother in law was making a carrot flute at Christmas. And we're like, you're an idiot. What are you doing? And it actually ended up working. And I'm like, what if we bring that into the video? And then that's what made the song. Now people like call him like the carrot flute guy. I'm like, what? So for this one, the contents of a moment for us was like, all right, we have this artist myself from Canada. We have this other artist from Zambia, a country that most people don't even know where it is on the map. So you actually you actually knew the artist. You had the artist's idea first. And you're like, how do we tell the story of that? Almost reverse engineered the story. Correct. For this one, we had the song first. For every other one, we were like, we had no idea this was going to blow up. All our content that had performed well at this point was skits. And every time we posted a non skit, it never did as well. So we really were just like, let's see what happens. I was very much inspired by like content creators like Mr. Beast. Yeah, as you can tell from like the whole editing style. And I edit all my TikToks. And so like the one word at a time. I love how in videos that it starts the first frame you hear. All right, guys, today we're going to blah, blah, blah. He just gets into it right away. And so I was inspired by that. Hence, this intro. So yeah, the first one, we had the relationship with the
