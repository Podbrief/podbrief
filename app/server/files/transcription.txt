Welcome to another edition of Acquisitions Anonymous. I'm Heather Anderson, one of your co-hosts. Michael and I are looking at a really cool deal today. Slight valuation issue. You'll see it right away, I think. But something that you would be proud to own and we would actually like to buy it, but just slight discount on the asking price. So stay tuned and take a look. Thank you. Today's sponsor is Employer Flexible. And what Employer Flexible does is really function as a fractional HR department for your company or business. I've used them numerous times in putting together my companies. I've used them when I've bought companies. I've used them when I started from scratch. And basically when you're moving quickly or when you don't want to spend the time putting together your own HR department, benefits, all that kind of stuff, and you want to get the scale of being part of a larger group, you can reach out to Employer Flexible. And what Employer Flexible does is give you that buying power as if you're part of a bigger group and all that kind of stuff. And for me, I love working with them for numerous reasons. One is I know the owners and a lot of the staff and they've always treated me super good. And then the second thing is I hate HR. Like I don't enjoy it at all. And this way I can know it gets done right. I get the benefits of having a big, fully staffed HR department and the flexibility of having a vendor like Employer Flexible being there as a partner throughout my journey and making sure that everybody I work with is happy, taken care of, and we can focus on what really matters in our business, which is take care of our customers. So you can find their contact details, locations of their various offices, as well as more details on how they will help your business by going to employerflexible.com. And again, that's employerflexible.com. And thanks to them for sponsoring today's episode. Michael, how are you today? Good. I want to talk about our worm farm venture. So do I. I mean, that is exciting. Where are we on that? I don't know. Our point person for the worm farm decided not to jump to the recording today. So we need to get Mills on this, but he's like the busiest one of all of us. So I don't know if it's like, it was going to work. But. We're in suspense. So, okay. So two things about the worm farm. So for those of you just tuning in today, we've had a hugely popular episode on buying a worm farm in Northern California. As of this morning, a hundred thousand people on Twitter have interacted or viewed our post about the worm farm episode, which is enormous. But number two, I think, Heather, this, I think it would be some really good content if we actually bought one of these businesses. That's where I'm leaning towards. I think we need to go in together, be the board of directors for this thing. We could hire a general manager, CEO of the business, have them come in. I think it'd be really good. As Bill and I call it really good radio, like quote unquote radio, like good entertainment. I would be so excited for like every aspect of it for our listeners and for us. I mean, it's a really cool, interesting company. We, you know, we're excited about it. We just need to get the financials. I think now we're sort of commiserating with some of our listeners about how hard that can be sometimes. You know, just to get a package. Call us back. Come on. Well, okay. And to be clear, I'm advocating for it. We either do the worm farm or something like the worm farm, like the pizza boat. One of those things, I think we should actually do that. I think it'd be good radio. That's what I'm saying. I have an inside story on the pizza boat. Someone in my contacts is a neighbor of the guy that owns the hotel in front of the pizza boat. And he told me a little story about how the pizza boat guy had to end up paying the hotel to not get kicked off that, you know, that stretch of the water. Because he was cutting into the hotel's business a little bit, I guess. For those of you also tuning in and not caught up with this, we did an episode about the only boat selling pizza in the British Virgin Islands that was for sale. Bill wanted to fly down and buy it. Good stuff. Okay, so at least, I guess I got to pitch this idea to the other guys, but we all go in, we buy a small business, like that's what I think we should do. But it's gotta be entertaining. It's gotta be like Worm Farm or better. Yeah, I am so ready for this. Let's do it. Let's go. We can record the board meetings and turn them into episodes. We could use it for the CEO search. Like, I think there's so many interesting things we could do with this whole thing. We could raise money. We could even do something a little bit bigger. We could raise money from the listeners because people want to invest in the Worm Farm. They do, actually, yeah. Honestly, I think this could be very, very interesting for a lot of people. Okay, all right. So, well, good news is I have a deal for today and there's no way we're buying it, but I think it'll be entertaining. We've already decided that? Okay. Well, wait till you see it. It came from a listener, so I think it'll be good. Okay, so I'll go ahead and read it if that's all right with you. All right. Okay, so it is a new business listing. It is a 15-year-old brand in the sports and military protective gear segments. It has a massive IP portfolio of 100-plus patents, 40% repeat customer rate, and used by NFL, NBA, NHL, all these and different types of athletes. The asking price, are you sitting down, Heather? I am, I am. Yes, I know you are because I can see you on video. Can I stand? My dad, who is a lovely human being, whenever there was some sort of news to call, he'd be like, are you sitting down? Yeah, like I'm sitting, I'm right next to you. Anyway, okay, the asking price, since you're sitting down, is $300 million. Whoa, whoa. I don't think I've ever seen that asking price that high. That's why I love this episode. They're bold here, they're very bold. Yeah, you just gotta go with it. Sales were $16,205,000, and they earned $2.264 million, so $2.2 million. So they are asking just shy of 140 times earnings. Okay, that's a nice multiple, interesting. So the good news is if you buy this business and you don't grow it, it will take you 140 years to get your money back. That's my favorite math. I've said that to sellers before when they're like, okay, I want this. I'm like, okay, do you think your business is gonna grow? Nah, probably not. Okay, do you know it will take me 14 years to get all my money back? Do you know I'll be dead by then? So you say that to a seller, they don't think it's that funny. Michael, I hope you're not dead in 14 years, but this one, we would be dead for sure, yes. Well, that's very kind of you. I mean, the odds are stacked against me. I'm very large, you know, I'm six foot five. I'm left-handed. I have a history of some family health issues. So I'm trying hard, but there's a good chance, and I'm accident-prone. So like all those things are not in the way. They're not in the way. Okay, shoot. Did you know left-handed people die on average younger than right-handed people? I did not know that. Why? I mean, what's the reason? The theory that I've read, and usually we die like 12 to 15 months younger on average. The theory that I've read is because the world is designed for right-handed people. So we like keep getting ourselves caught in like combines. We're always messing, yeah. Using right-handed scissors the wrong way, and like, you know, stabbing ourselves. Okay, I buy it, but okay. So I'm short, and I'm right-handed. So apparently I've got good odds here, living a long time. Being a female helps also, if you guys live longer than us. And being female, that works too. Okay. Well, that was depressing. Okay, back to the listing. Website Closers presents a rare opportunity for an investor to acquire this 15-year-old premier company operating in the rapidly growing sports and military protected markets. Its extensive IP portfolio, established brand, and impeccable reputation make it capable of becoming the fourth largest multi-billion dollar sports company in the world. Their products are designed to protect people of all ages who are active in sports, as well as those in the military and law enforcement. The products are in high demand, but the company's limited capital has impeded sales growth. The company's proprietary and patented SKUs have generated several first-in-world products that boast a 40% repeat customer race and confirms its product's claims to protect and maintain customer satisfaction. The sports products are made for kids in youth sports, as well as adults playing amateur and professional sports who prioritize protection or will to pay a premium for tested, proven, and certified gear. Let's see, how much longer does this go? Oh my God, it keeps going. It keeps going, but I did notice that there's helmets for people playing pickleball in here somewhere. That was pretty surprising to me. We're gonna have to wear a helmet to play pickleball now, I guess. So one thing they do here, and I'll pull it up, they talk about, or they accidentally list the name of the company, and it is called unequal.com. So let me pull that up here. We could look at the website while we're looking at it. So it looks like- Yeah, very interesting. So we're pulling it up here. It looks like this guy has on some sort of, it's like body armor. We handle impact shock differently and better than typical plastics and foams. They use battlefield armor and cutting-edge materials like Kevlar, Acceleron, and Triter to disperse impact away from the head and body with over 100 patents, some of the finest military and police units trusted every day. So here they have lacrosse player pads, lacrosse player shirt. It looks like a lot of lacrosse stuff. Do they do other stuff besides that? Well, I was thinking helmets. I mean, so are people wearing these vests? I was thinking it was head protection. Yeah, they have a liner that goes inside of your helmet to keep you from- Oh, there it is. From getting a concussion, I assume. Let's see, helmet liners. Oh, here's their whole bunch of stuff. A bunch of different shirts, girdles, exoskeletons, insoles, padded sleeves, face shields, I think, is what this is. It looks like different- Interesting. That doesn't actually work. Their website doesn't work. Yeah, so it's a really interesting, like, anti-concussion. And then there's this idea of, I've never heard of this before. They fight against this Comotio Cordis. It's the number one killer in baseball, number two killer in youth sports, is a lethal disruption of the heart's rhythm that happens as a result of a sudden blow to the chest from a stick, ball, or hand. Oh, wow. Yeah, when people just get hit. Yeah, I've even heard about it happening in golf, if you get hit just at the right moment in the right place on your chest. It can happen. Because there's electricity running your heart. And if that little thing gets knocked out of whack, you're in trouble. Interesting. It is extremely rare, though. So it's kind of interesting. Would you wear a vest for that? Because the chances are so low, but interesting. So it seems like it's mostly, like, foam padding that can be put in different parts, you know, on a vest, in a helmet, different places. And it's got some kind of patents, obviously a lot of patents, to, you know, it's very specialized, obviously, the way this foam is made. 100%. Well, and this is great. This is something to like here, is we're not, they're not selling increased performance for kids, which I think is a very crowded space. This is about like, hey, you're sending your kid out to play lacrosse or soccer or baseball or football, like, you know, how much is your kid's safety and health worth for you as a parent? And like, it's a lot. Yeah, right. Now, the patents, I think, is where they must be coming up with the idea of this valuation. This is my, I'm guessing, because they say they have over 100 patents. That seems like a lot of patents to me. You know, I've recently talked with someone who is in the business of ensuring trade secrets, which is sort of like a step below. You don't get something patented. And they were explaining to me why a lot of companies are getting away from getting patents, because when you get them, the information all becomes public and it becomes very easy for someone to kind of rip off your idea and just make something slightly different than that. So I don't know that, you know, I don't know that these patents are certainly not worth a 300 million, I can't imagine, but I'm just trying to guess at where they came up with that number. And I'm thinking that they think there's that value in the patents. It seems like it. I mean, the way they talk about here, and I'll read here on the listing, the company's intellectual property is a significant achievement. They have patents on these proprietary products in 24 countries, with their patent portfolio valued at 322 million. Google, parenthesis, Google purchased Motorola for 12.5 billion to acquire its thousands of phone-related patents that enabled Google to launch its phone dynasty. The company's extensive patent portfolio on sport and military protection will give the buyer a commanding presence and distinct advantage in these markets. The brand has gotten recognition for products designed to offer protection from the Commodio, Cordis, and so on. So I think, I mean, if I'm understanding what the broker is saying here, they're saying you're not really buying an e-commerce business here. You're buying a set of patents that they've produced through their research, and you're betting that uptake on these type of things is going to grow as more and more, there's more and more mandates for safety, more and more parents are interested in it. And here they talk about, like, there's a leading UK soccer team that has mandated all members wear head protection. And European soccer leagues are considering mandating head protection league-wide, which will open a potential market of 100 million players that would be required to wear rated, certified head protection for which the company is well-known. All right, taking a quick pause here. I have something to tell you. This is Michael. I hate bookkeeping. I hate bookkeeping, I hate doing HR, I hate doing all that kind of stuff. But for bookkeeping, I have found a solution. It is my friend Charlie's business called cloudbookkeeping.com. So that's cloudbookkeeping.com. They are your perfect partner if you want to get bookkeeping out of your hair and focus on making your company, your customers happier and more successful. So please give them a call. Call Charlie, cloudbookkeeping.com, tell them we sent ya. They're a great way if you're a business buyer, if you're a business owner, you're tired of hassling with getting your bookkeeping done. He's got a whole fleet of people that are well-trained and work for him. He's located here in San Antonio, so I can tell you because of that, he's awesome. And they're a great partner for you to potentially call to help with all your bookkeeping needs so you can do the important stuff in your business rather than worry about getting your books right. So give Charlie a call, cloudbookkeeping.com. And now, back to the episode. And it looks like the head protection for soccer was, they showed it in some of the photos, looks kind of like a headband, like a sweatband, but it's thicker. And so it's not a helmet. They're not saying that the soccer players are gonna be wearing a full helmet, but it looks like there's this padded sort of headband, which makes sense. I'm sure it adds a lot of protection. There they are. I remember when I was a kid and I would do headers and I would totally feel like my bell had been rung multiple times. Yeah, I'm sure it was. I mean, honestly, my son played soccer and those could be brutal, those headers. And sometimes just crashing into each other, not seeing that the other person was coming at you. So I think that's, there's probably a lot of growth, but I mean, 140 years worth of, I don't know. Why haven't they grown it? They've had the company 15 years. Sounds like they've, with over a hundred patents, it sounds like the sellers are really into developing, just developing new products and getting them patented, but they're maybe not, maybe they didn't focus a lot on the growth. But nonetheless, it's still only at 2.2 million EBITDA, you know? Right. I, yeah. Valuation's obviously just not realistic, unless there's some company out there that is doing something similar and these patents are just the thing they need to take off. Yeah. That's the only thing I can imagine. You're betting there is going to, the only way this, I guess, makes anything close to sense is you're betting that this becomes a huge market that somebody has to have. But it's, you know, unlike cell phones, which at the time, I think they list the parallel there where Google bought Motorola for patents. And I think that was in 2013, 2014. Like cell phones were already enormous. Like it was pretty clear how that was going to be worth $12 billion. But here you have this situation where it's like, okay, well, this is hopefully an emerging market because there's another solution to concussions from soccer, from headers. You just don't do headers. That's what- Oh, that was a thought. Well, in some soccer leagues, like kids' soccer leagues, you're not allowed to do headers. I think that makes sense, to be honest. It is kind of a strange, you know, it's soccer. It's all about the feet and all of a sudden they're crashing heads. Now, I'm going back to my earlier comment. Isn't it, couldn't someone else develop similar, you know, padding? You know, is there something so special that this is the only padding that anybody would buy? This is what's going to be adopted across all these markets or couldn't someone else develop something making these patents not that worthwhile? I mean, it is just padding. I don't know, you know, I'm not an expert here, but I feel like someone else could come along and make something pretty similar. Yeah. Well, there's- For less than 300 million, is my point. 100%. There is this question of, as you would look at this business, your due diligence would have a heck of a lot of visibility into what the patent portfolio actually looks like. And I think that's what they're saying the whole thing. They're saying the whole thing is, you know, this is a highly defensible patent portfolio and that is the fundamental bet you'd be making here, right? Like, can you, you know, A, is this going to be a big market in the future? And then B, like, what happens when you try to go defend against competitors using your patent portfolio? And I think those are the two big questions. And I think one, yeah, you could imagine that this becomes a multi-billion dollar industry if, you know, given the trajectory of how we're going on protecting kids and investing to do that. The patent portfolio is a big question mark to me and something you would have to go dig into to understand. Yeah, and I mean, it's almost like, you know, it's defensible, right? So someone is going to copy it, right? If this market takes off, you're going to have lawsuits. I don't know. That's just, it's a lot of gambles here. A lot of them. Can we talk about the other, like, red flag? Like, why is a company with a $300 million list price on WebsiteClosers.com? I mean, usually, WebsiteClosers is one of my favorite. They write great teasers, which is why we do them a lot. But like, they're known for like, you know, a portfolio of like, what's it called? The people doing astrology, right? Or like, crossword puzzle websites, right? Like, that's what I expect from Website Closers. And it's like, oh no, no, hey, we're this like, very niche IP portfolio that has been somewhat monetized, and it's $300 million, so. I don't think the buyer of something like this is going to be looking here. That's for one. Yeah, and I have a feeling this broker probably thought, oh, 2.2 million of EBITDA, okay, that's in my lane. I can do that. And then, you know, upon discussion, you know, the seller names their price about all this IP, and it's 300 million, and he's just putting it out there. That's my impression. This is one of those ones where the universe of people for whom this would be worth $300 million, there's probably a handful of companies, you know, potentially. And it's like. And they probably already have a similar product, right? Don't they? Maybe. Patting, at least, right? Of some kind. Maybe, yeah. And it's like, well, why is this publicly listed? Like, you know who they are. Like, call them all. It's like, it's just a, it just doesn't make much sense. Except for helping us record like an awesome episode, which I'm totally cool with, so. Yeah. It is used by NFL, you know, all the big sporting leagues. Okay, so, oh, I'm sorry to interrupt you. That's important to, I want to make sure I articulate what it says very clearly, because it's not actually used by the sporting leagues. It's used by NFL, MLB, NHL, NBA, FIFA, Big Ten, SEC, and Olympic athletes. The athlete word is very important. That means they just have one person there who's a customer. It is not an NFL. There's nothing in here that does anything to say that it's officially sanctioned by any of those leagues. But this broker did a really smart thing, which is say something technically correct, but easily misinterpreted to indicate that, oh, this is like used by the SEC and mandated by them. Like, this would be great. But that does not appear to be the case. Well, I fell for it, Steve. Look, I was all impressed. And you're right. I was trying to figure that out. It's such a small company. How can they be selling? You're right. It's the athletes from all those different sports. One or two uses it, puts an extra pad in their helmet or whatever, or wears the vest. Yeah, I think it's a great product. I think it's growth market, where definitely the idea of safety and certainly anything that is related to concussions is a big deal and you're gonna have growth. But I can't believe that these products are all that unique. And even the patents aren't all that unique. Like I said, you could create something very similar, but slightly different and get your own patent. Compete. It doesn't say where this is manufactured, does it? I did not see that. I'm assuming. Yeah, it doesn't say USA. So I'm assuming that means it's Asia or somewhere overseas. It says here the company typically maintains a six to 12 month inventory supply and orders replenishment products as needed. That would tend to indicate these are contract manufactured someplace overseas. Yep, somewhere. They put them here in a 16,000 square foot warehouse, which is not that big for 27 million. No. So this is a small company. It's got a unique product, probably a really cool seller that's into developing and inventing things. That's great. I just, I don't know where they're coming up with that price. And like, let's just say they came to a regular multiple on a 2.2, then it might be a nice company. Then there might be something interesting. I mean, you'd have to do a lot of marketing to kind of, you know, grow and maintain your position. I don't know, what multiple would you pay for something like this, Michael? I would be, it depends on how much they've been growing so far, that would affect my opinion on it. But let's say they've been growing just five to 10% per year. I would be excited to own this business at five to six X, even though. Yeah, right. I think that's, I think that's much more of a realistic investment thesis here. You know, this business is in a nice niche. It has this patent portfolio. You have a lot of pricing power and a very clear path to how you get to your target market, right? This is your, you go to Facebook, Instagram, you sell ads and you try to target moms who are terrified that little Jimmy is gonna get a concussion when he's playing lacrosse, right? And you, and she's willing to pay whatever it is to feel better about Jimmy playing lacrosse. And so I think that gives you something awesome in terms of owning this business is, you are not selling athletic equipment. You're in the business of selling peace of mind for Jimmy's mom. And I think that is just a great business to be in and gives you tons of margin to be able to raise prices and be able to hammer in on that specific niche and really own it. And that's why I'm saying like, I would, this would be a screaming deal for me at that five to six X because I think you have tons of pricing power. I think you've got a lot of runway to grow. I think it's a great place to be in. And that's making the assumption that this patent portfolio is probably just BS. That's how I see most patent portfolios turn into. They're mostly BS if you're trying to build an entire business around them. So anyway, I don't know, what do you think? I agree with you. And I would really wanna know how fast it's grown. It's been around 15 years. So I don't think it's grown that fast. I think most of those 15 years, I mean, that's a lot of patents every year in 15 years. So I think they've just been putting most of their efforts into that and less so into marketing and finding their market, although the market has sort of found them. So they've got a good effective product. And I would be happy to own something like this too, right? But in your cocktail party test, this one would feel really good, right? You'd come in and say, I protect children and athletes from concussions and what does that commode? I can't say it. Yeah, the heart stopping. Your heart stopping, the heart stopping thing. I mean, yeah, it would feel great. And that would be, it's kind of a mission driven almost business that someone could feel just fantastic about owning. It's just not, it's a six multiple at the most. That's where it feels like a great deal and something to own. And then there's a big, for me, there's a big asterisk. If this patent portfolio is real and you assume the market's gonna keep growing, I could see it being that kind of, worth it as a strategic purchase to another buyer, but as an individual investor, like it just doesn't make, that's too big of a bet to make. And as a non-strategic, so let's say Under Armour or Nike comes in and tries to buy something like this, they have a huge distribution advantage. They can leverage, they can try to explore that niche, but I don't know. Usually those guys are pretty smart. Usually by now they've already looked at something like this and figured out it's not worth anywhere near $300 million or it's not strategic to them at all and that's not a space they wanna be in. So anyway, that's why it kinda doesn't make sense to me in terms of the story of how they got to this place. Right, because you're buying it in addition to your helmet. You're not buying it with your helmet. I don't know. It is someone that goes, like I agree with you. You're going out of your way to have peace of mind and feel like you've done everything you can to protect either your child or yourself, which is great. Didn't talk much about the military side of it. Now you're looking at that. Yeah, it's kinda hidden in their website. I don't know how big of a business it is for them. They only have three, which is kind of a lightweight body shield, some sort of plasticky thing, and then a thing that like fits on their, some sort of helmet-y type thing that fits under a baseball cap. It's like an under baseball cap helmet. That's pretty cool. Yeah, that's pretty cool. I could probably use that when I'm around my teenagers. Um, so. Well, that's a growth market potentially, but you know, selling to law enforcement is also really usually a very long sales cycle. That's awful. And it kind of requires an insider, yeah. That's awful. Those are not easy, yeah. All right, well look, I think it sounds like we would love to own this business as an e-commerce business, not as a $300 million venture play on an IP portfolio. Um, and if something were to change where they come down by say $285 million on their price, we could probably, we'd be interested in, it might be a good deal. We could do this and a worm farm. Yeah, we could do both, ooh. You know, one-time sales, I think I would get much more excited about this, but this is something I wouldn't even really even start talking to somebody when they have this kind of, it's clear they're looking for a buyer who's not me. That's totally fine. If they can get it, they can get it.
Yep. No SBA loans on this one. I'm sorry. See you ever again. All right. All right. Hey, let us know what you think about this episode. Leave us a review. We actually read the comments on YouTube, so leave a comment there. Just let us know what you think. Cool. All right. See you, everybody.
