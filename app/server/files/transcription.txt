On average, a million streams is around $4,000 USD on Spotify. And we're averaging like 60 million streams a month right now. So things are just pretty crazy. And I don't think most people know that there's that potential because in music, you hear there's no money in streaming. But I'm like, that's because labels own 80% of your songs. But if you own your songs, there's a shit ton of money in streaming. Okay, welcome first. So I don't know what the real intro of this is going to be, but I wanted to introduce this to you guys. Sam had put this on the calendar like, hey, we're recording with Connor and Brianna, and I think he knows you guys in person or in real life or whatever. And he kind of loosely said, he said something like, oh, I was like, is that the rapper kind of music person? And then when I was doing the prep for this, I was like, oh, it's these people. Oh, my God. I love your stuff. I am so excited for this, as you can probably tell because I'm screaming. But I'm so excited for this because I think what you do is literally amazing. I think it is so smart. And I think it is so impressive what you've done. You know, we've had the chance to talk to Mr. Beast on this podcast, and we've talked to Hasan Minhaj in the comedy world. We've talked to some Cody Co on the YouTube side, who you kind of look like. I think you know that. But I do. I got to say, I think you are playing TikTok like a fiddle. I think you have figured out the thing. Every platform that comes out, there's like the people that kind of come from the old world onto that and just kind of try to do the same thing, but maybe shorter or faster or video or whatever. And then there's people who figure out that medium for what it is. And I think you've figured out how to do music on TikTok like nobody else. I don't know if you're a marketing genius or if you fell into that, but either way, it's working. And therefore, I am so excited to have this conversation because last night, you could tell I'm kind of tired because I was binging your content. And I was just so inspired. I was so inspired. I don't do anything in the music world. I bet 99% of the listeners don't do anything in the music world. But I was so inspired just by what you were doing. So that's my intro of just fanboy because I can't believe how good you guys are at what you do. That was the nicest intro ever. Well, thank you so much. Yeah, no, as far as the marketing stuff goes, that's all Brianna, which is why it's so fun to be able to do this conversation with her because we do everything together. But so many of my ideas that have gone viral are her ideas. So let's give people a little context and we can either explain it or I do think it would be better to literally just show it. So I'm going to love the show. So I have a bunch that I liked. Do you know how much I like this? I was last night. So I'm doing this on my laptop and I'm not logged into TikTok. And I kept hitting the like button. And I was trying to like it. And it's like create an account. I almost created a second account just to give you the like because I was so I felt like you deserved it. Like, oh, thank you. Don't you feel like someone earned it? That's how I felt. I love it. Play a video. Play one of the videos. Yo, yo, yo, what is he doing? Oh, yes. He was telling me that if you if you cut a carrot a certain way, you can play it like a flute. He really thinks that's going to work. Apparently, it's a thing. Just ignore him. Ready? Uh, yeah. Do me a favor. Pull up that one session. Yeah, look, they said that I couldn't do it. So I went and did it. W's only, you know, I've been winning top of the world. The globe is spinning, spinning. If you know, you know, I've been on a mission. Mission. Okay, let's get it. Got a little time on my hands like a wristwatch. I don't got time for the breaks in the pit stop race to the gridlock. Take it like Chris Rock right to the chin. Still win heavy metals like Slipknot. Got the driving. I got tunnel vision. I just hit my stride the way I run the business. I've been making paper like I'm done to me. Let's see the end game. I got one division. Look, I don't ever bother with a critic. Hit him with a chronic color. So you create these, these little like opening skits and you, you don't hit them. Like, okay. Traditional way of doing things. Somebody wants to be a musician. They're going to fire up TikTok and they're going to just play their song. Maybe they play the song with a music video already baked in. And if it's me and I'm just hearing the opening of a song, it's usually pretty slow. There's a little bit of a buildup, you know, just like the, just a little bit of instrumental playing at the beginning. Or they might say, Hey, I'm Sean. This is my new track. Give it a listen. Right. Kind of boring, sort of begging for attention. Whereas you have these little opening skits that gets you curious of what's going to happen. You're playing all these characters like, you know, Eddie Murphy in whatever that movie was. You're Tyler Perry and you're playing all the characters. And then, then you hit them with a track that's actually like surprisingly good for how simple the intro is. I don't know how, how to explain it, but. This is how you got famous for doing this stuff on TikTok. Sure. Yeah. No. So I make music specifically in the kind of hip hop rap world, a little bit of pop sometimes. But yeah. So the whole goal with these videos is to not make it seem like you're selling someone, especially on TikTok. The moment you feel like someone's like, Hey, check out my song. You're going to swipe away. So you have to provide entertainment first. And we have found the best way to do that is through skits. It was really easy because Connor's been acting since he was six years old. So it was the perfect way to kind of merge those two worlds. And it, it worked. Yeah. I saw you were in a bunch of like, well, like good luck, Chuck, a bunch of movies. I started acting when I was six in Toronto, where I grew up, started with commercials. When I was 10, I did a movie called Cinderella Man. I played the son of Russell Crowe in that film. And that was kind of the first huge project that was ever a part of. First time I went to LA for the premiere, I signed with a US agent. And so from a kid, I've just been doing TV and film my whole life. And then when COVID hit and production shut down, I was like, what do we do? I was working at Alphapaw at the time, the pet company. I left that job. And then I was like, okay, Connor's really good at rapping. He's, he's loved hip hop for so many years. Why don't we try marketing that? And he didn't want to, because he thought TikTok was kind of lame. Like it was in the era where people just did those little dances. So I took some YouTube videos he had filmed, turned them into vertical pieces of content. He's like, I'm a thespian. I'm not going to be on TikTok. I'm an actor. I was naive. I make films. My biggest regret is not starting sooner on like social media specifically. I'd always been anti that. Once he saw a video go viral and then it translate to streams the next day, he's like, okay, maybe we can do TikTok. That changed everything. Yeah, every, every time. Let's pause for a sec. Yeah. We got to say the background here because people said Alphapaw. So basically, I am friends with Ramon who then became... Me, Sean and Ramon are all buddies. Ramon is on episode two or three or four. Sean talks to him. He had a pet... It's episode two. He had a soap opera company and then a pet company. I remember Ramon bought this pet business that seemed outlandish at the time, turned into a successful business. I went to Vegas to hang out with him. I think I was there regardless. And I just went to hang out to the office. Brianna was his right hand woman running marketing and everything else at the company. I go to this brand new office that he has. And Ramon's like, Connor is Brianna's wife. He's actually just going to help us move. He's trying to make it... By the way, Sam, Ramon told me that you showed up like high on drugs because you were afraid of flying. So you're like, you're like doped up. I hated flying. And I took up, I took too much medicine. And I got to, I like, I was still figuring out the dosage. And I got to the office. I was like, I got to go to sleep. So I was like all messed up. I was like, I'm sorry, guys. I'm like intoxicated. But I met, I remember meeting Connor. Connor was moving, yeah. He was moving boxes like you were because you were an actor. And you're in between shit. And you're just moving. And then like months later, Ramon was like, hey, remember Brianna's wife or husband? She, he's like trying to actually become a rapper. And he's actually good. And I'm like, the guy moving? What really? I don't buy it. I don't buy it. And then you had like some traditional rap music videos. And I'm like, OK, he actually is quite good. Then Ramon was like, hey, Brianna's actually left Alpha Paul. And she's going to take over his shit. And then I started seeing the TikToks. And I'm like, oh, my God, this guy's the best. And then you blew up. And now it looks like you have like 8 million monthly listens on your Spotify. He, Ramon's telling me that you guys are independent. Yeah. So you like own all the music. And he's like saying like, dude, their numbers for revenue are outlandish. You can say if you want or not. But like they're making a really good living. Now, Connor's going on tour. He's with Hoody Allen. He's in Europe. He's selling out shows in Europe. And now you're like legit famous. He looks like your top song. Spinnin' has 105 million downloads. The other one is 74 million. Like you guys are killing it. And I knew you just as this nice guy who was moving boxes. This was only I think this was three years ago. This wasn't long ago. Maybe four. You know what? The first time we met was at a comedy show five years ago in 2018. Do you remember that? It was like a Chris D'Elia show. And then, yeah, you came to the office. I think you and I were like butting heads that day. And then Ramon's like, oh, he's just on drugs. And I'm like, OK, that makes sense. Yeah. What Ramon told me. Yeah. Ramon sent a voice message to me last night. He's like, yeah, Sam came to the office. But he was like, you know, a little bit like doped up from the flight. And he goes, you know, Sam normally asks like pretty direct questions. Like add drugs. Oh, Sam was getting behind everyone's laptops. Like, what are you working on? Why are you doing it this way? And I'm like, I don't remember that. I don't remember that. Get out of here. You're making my team nervous as hell. And Brianna, you don't know this, but I also saw your work before we ever met because you were behind a lot of the ad. So Alphapaw scaled like crazy. So Ramon bought this business. That's a dog ramp business initially. So it was literally like it was called Sausage Dog. Sausage Dog. Oh, that's right. Wow. Which is also what they used to call my dorm in college. But so well played. So then it's like little dogs use the ramp to get up on the bed or on the couch or down from the couch. I have four of them in my house because I got a little dog. And I also know Ramon. So he sent me four free ramps. So these ramps are great. But I was like, how do you sell these? Like, are people looking for these? He's like, no, most people don't even realize they want it. So we got to make ads that teach them that they want it. And I was just getting into e-com. Ramon's the reason I started an e-com brand because I was sitting at his house hearing the Shopify on his phone. I was like, dude, I want that noise in my life. How do you do that? So I decided to start one. And to help me, he goes, he's like here, I added you to my ads account, which is like basically like adding you as a cosigner on a bank account. Basically, nobody gives their Facebook ad account to somebody else. But that's very intimate. Ramon is that kind of guy, that kind of friend. And so I'm in the ad account, and I'm looking at all your ads that you created because you had all these video ads that were working to sell pads and ramps and all this stuff. And I was like, damn, I need somebody who's good at creating ads. And I think, is it right that you were just kind of like at that warehouse or you would just like come up with the concept yourself and figure out like test them? Is that kind of where you got this like quick video production? Like you and your sister, I think. It was mainly myself and Catherine. Do you remember Catherine? Catherine and I ran the marketing, and then my little sister would help me. But basically, we would just try and like either pull at someone's heartstrings, like we would start a video with maybe an injured dog, and then instantly a person that has an injured dog can relate to that. And they're like, oh, like, and then we show the solution. And then a cute little dog. We literally bought a chihuahua. She's upstairs just to use like for marketing ads. And we would show her trying to jump up on the couch. And instantly, everyone that has a chihuahua is like, oh, my dog does the same thing. Boom. Here's a solution. And it just freaking worked. It was wild. Like I couldn't believe it. We went from an office as big as a bathroom to like a 20,000 square foot warehouse within a year. Yeah, I was doing a lot of moving. Connor was moving a lot. Connor would help film. He would help edit the ads. Yeah, it was a family production. And then all the high performing ads we filmed in either our living room or Chloe's living room. Yeah, in our house. And then when I was like, okay, I really want to do my own thing. We want to start a family. I need to leave this pet company. It broke my heart because Ramon's my best friend, but I had to ultimately leave. And I was trying to start other companies. I'm like, what can I start? I started like a coffee brand, like a Christian brand. And then our friend Cliff Weitzman, he's the CEO of Speechify. Oh, we know Cliff. You know, I love Cliff. He says hello. I was talking to him this morning. I said I was going to be on. Yeah, Cliff was over for dinner and I was just venting my frustrations of product boredom. And he's like, Bree, stop. Like, this is your product. He's like, Kris Jenner, the shit out of him. So the next day I stopped. I had a huge order, an inventory of coffee, and I let it go to waste. And I'm like, we're going all in on this. And I pretty much just used the same mindset I used to sell the dog ramps to sell his music. It's like, how can we hook someone in? And how can we tell a story around this song? Because a lot of music these days is just like a really cool beat and like some generic lyrics. Right. But I'm like, there's a lack of storytelling. And I think that's what music online is missing. And we did it. So and we're doing it independently. So. So you can see it because as I was doing my binge, I can't even call it research. I was just enjoying myself going down, did the Tour de France down your profile. The first video actually on your YouTube channel is pretty dope. I don't know. Sam, have you seen the very first video that the first song that he posted? Yes. Is that is that the one where you rap about how you? Yes. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yes. Yeah, yeah, yeah. What is it called? The S word or what did you say? What'd you call it? It's just S, just the letter S. So you rap about how you used to have a stutter. And then in the song, you're basically every like a bunch of the words start with S. And by the way, you sent me down a Watsky rabbit hole to last night. We love Watsky. Huge, huge inspiration for that. I've never heard of him. He's dope. So anyways, that's the first song. And it's like, OK, this person clearly has talent, but also it's like, I don't know. That's different. Yeah. It's never been easier to go on, I don't know, Fruit Loops and make a beat and then try to try to rap and like do 15 seconds of a good rap. Like that's, I guess, never been easier. Would you say like it's kind of more competitive than ever to do that part? Totally, totally. I mean, there's what, 60,000 songs uploaded every day. I think the data is closer to 100 now, but roughly, I'd say to be safe, 60,000 songs uploaded every day. Yeah, the ease of being able to make music now, especially in the hip hop space with programs like Fruity Loops. And Splice, where you can find samples that are royalty free. Yeah, a lot of people are making music way more efficiently than ever. You can see like kind of the progression, like, OK, you're getting some views, putting out some good tracks. But like there was, I could almost draw a line and be like, then they figured out how to create like hooks for these videos. Yeah, it was the presentation. And then everything was different after that. Is that when you joined, Brianna? Like, is that kind of when you Kris Jennered the shit out of him? Yeah, that's when I really stopped trying to do a million things and focused just on him. And the biggest moment for us was creating a series. That's when we started the Spin the Globe series, where he would spin a globe and land on a country and collab with an artist. That took us from like here to like... Yeah, that took off like crazy. That first video that we did, where we landed on Zambia and found the Zambian artist, that video has 72 million views on TikTok and 72 million views on YouTube Shorts. So explain that video. Yes. Yeah, so it was an idea where I had this song with this artist named Killa, who's this independent artist from Zambia. When we first worked with him, he had less than a thousand monthly listeners. He had 189 monthly listeners. And now he's over a million because of that song, which is incredible. Wow. And it's like changed his life. But essentially, we were like, all right, how can we market this? And I was like, all right, we need a strong hook in the first two to three seconds. Hold on, let me play it. I want you to break it down. Sure. No, please do. Yeah, yeah, yeah. All right, I'm going to spin this globe and wherever my finger lands, I'm going to find an artist from that country to collaborate with me on a song. Let's see what happens. Zambia. All right, well, let's find out more about Zambia. I started researching some up and coming artists and one guy really stood out to me. His name is Killa. He's a rapper from Lusaka, which is the capital of Zambia. I felt like his style and his voice would sound perfect on the song I'm working on. So I reached out to him. I sent him the beat. And then a few days later, he sent me back. So that whole thing, five seconds there, like the speed that you hit them with that initial hook. You're already started. You're like mid word. You're like, all right, I'm going to spin this globe. Now you're doing something interesting visually. And then you set up the premise, the stakes of like, wherever my finger lands, I'm going to find an artist and do a song with them, which, OK, I've never heard of that before. So where does this idea come from? And like, how much time did you put into that first, getting that first five seconds to be good? I was literally at the gym with Connor's mom. And I thought of it and I texted him. I said, I'm stopping at Target. We're grabbing a globe. Here's the idea. And his mom parked the car. I ran and got it. It was like 19 bucks. And to be honest, at the time, we didn't realize it would blow up. And we posted on a Sunday and it got three million views the same day. And I'm like, oh, shit. OK, this is a series. We have to do this again. And instantly I went on my phone. I'm like, what country's next? And I searched hashtag Dutch rap because I really wanted a Dutch artist. I think that language is so beautiful. And I found this guy named Benz. Then we did episode two, two weeks later. And boom, that's spinning. And that's the song that now has over 100 million streams on Spotify in less than nine months. That's so insane. That's it is insane. Yeah. So that first one that that that you were just playing, it really was just like, OK, how do we make content around the song? What's the content of a moment for something visual? What's something visual we can do? Right. So for spinning like the other one, you played with the carrot flute. It was that idea of like, all right, this flute is such a strong element of the song. I remember watching a video back in the day where someone made it. No, no, no, no, no. Christian, our brother in law was making a carrot flute at Christmas. And we're like, you're an idiot. What are you doing? And it actually ended up working. And I'm like, what if we bring that into the video? And then that's what made the song. Now people like call him like the carrot flute guy. I'm like, what? So for this one, the contents of a moment for us was like, all right, we have this artist myself from Canada. We have this other artist from Zambia, a country that most people don't even know where it is on the map. So you actually you actually knew the artist. You had the artist's idea first. And you're like, how do we tell the story of that? Almost reverse engineered the story. Correct. For this one, we had the song first. For every other one, we were like, we had no idea this was going to blow up. All our content that had performed well at this point was skits. And every time we posted a non skit, it never did as well. So we really were just like, let's see what happens. I was very much inspired by like content creators like Mr. Beast. Yeah, as you can tell from like the whole editing style. And I edit all my TikToks. And so like the one word at a time. I love how in videos that it starts the first frame you hear. All right, guys, today we're going to blah, blah, blah. He just gets into it right away. And so I was inspired by that. Hence, this intro. So yeah, the first one, we had the relationship with the Zambian artist first. But after the first episode, it was very organic. And we found the artists like literally two days before the song was recorded. And why do you think this video popped off like that? I think the hook is really strong. I'm going to spin this globe wherever my finger lands. It's like, all right, what's about to happen? Is he going to go there? Or I'm going to find an artist. Immediately, you're interested where he's going to land. Right. And it's visual. You see a spinning globe. Now you're going to stick around and see. All right, let's see where it lands. I land on a country like Zambia, something most people haven't heard of. And I say, I'm going to collaborate with an artist. Now there's another hook of, oh, what's this guy going to look like? What's he going to sound like? What's the song going to sound like? And then they stick around. Is he even going to be good? Right. Totally. And how many times did you have to spin that globe to land on Zambia? Oh, gosh, I couldn't even tell you. Way too many times. Yeah, that's another good TikTok like behind the scenes. But yeah, every couple seconds, like every four to five seconds, there's just something new. There's like a new like if you're thinking of leaving, you're like, OK, wait, maybe I'll stay. I'm thinking of leaving. Oh, wait, I want to see him. Oh, he's about to start. I'll stay. Like there's even with the carrot flute video, you'll notice every time there's like a dull moment, we have a of the drill. And it's like, oh, I'm staying. Like the weird brother pops in and like surprises. It's like every four to five seconds. Two or three seconds, almost like the attention is about to lapse. Open up a new curiosity. We even do that with the music creation. So if Connor's writing a verse and the flow is the same for too long, I'll be like, that's not contentable. I need you to switch your flow up faster so that there can be a new moment where the beat drops and the producer goes. Yeah. Like, yeah, when once we started seeing how well the content was doing for the music, I started approaching my my creative process with writing the music, thinking about what the content would be. And a lot of times the content would come first. So I would think, you know, that whole carrot flute video did so well. And then we started thinking, what other weird instruments could we use? And then we would think of a weird instrument like a xylophone. And then we made a xylophone beat. Oh, or one we wanted to do on where the fire alarm goes off mid recording session. But he's like, wait, stay. That sounds sick. And then they bring out the beat pad and make a song. We wrap over a fire alarm. Yeah, yeah. So a lot of times we would think of the content first and then make the song. Was there like a revenue number in mind that you guys need to have in order to make this a full time job? Yeah, my my dream was like, I want to make $10,000 a month from this. I'm like, if we can make $10,000 a month, I'll be like the happiest person in the world. And I don't know if I don't know if you guys know how it works, but it's roughly there's a lot of variables, but on average, a million streams is around $4,000.
thousand dollars USD on Spotify on Spotify. And we're averaging like 60 million streams a month right now across our things are just pretty crazy. And I don't think most people know that there's that potential because in music you hear there's no money in streaming. But I'm like, that's because labels own 80% of your songs. But if you own your songs, there's a shit ton of money in streaming. And I kind of want to just bring awareness to that. Yeah. Well, what was like the Alright, so you guys were just doing your thing. And then there was that that pop moment. What was the first month of sales on the pop? Like when it when it when the when the first video really worked out? There's a three month delay in accounting. So whatever you get from like, January, February, March, you get it in April. And I remember that pop moment got us our first six figure month. Yeah. And we lost our minds. What were you making per month before that? Like, was it like, kind of under $10,000 to $100,000? Yeah, yeah, yeah. No, that globe series really like if I showed you the chart of my Spotify for artists, you see my daily streams were here and then it just explodes like way up. What's really cool is that a lot of people have a big moment and then they slow down, they get comfortable. But the second we had that big moment, I'm like, we're pulling all nighters, we're going harder than we've ever gone. So you can see the chart, it goes up and it stays up, which is like the beauty of it because we didn't stop. Like, I literally remember our baby was sleeping. He was four months old during the globe series. And we would take turns pulling all nighters. Conor would be editing the videos, go in, give him a bottle, keep editing. It was crazy. We were on crack. I don't think we would. I don't know how we did it. Last night when I was watching all the videos, I thought Conor is a genius. And then now I realized that Brianna is a genius, actually. And actually, Conor, you could just go get a drink of water. I just have 1000 questions for you. This is so amazing. So you really did. I'm curious, just from a relationship point of view, how did y'all meet? And when did you meet? And at the time, was it like, I'm going to be a rapper? And you're like, you got it, honey. Go for it. No, we were 10 and 11 years old. We lived in the same apartment complex. When I was telling you earlier, when I did that movie Cinderella Man, so the first time I went to LA for that premiere, after that, I started staying in LA for a few months every year for auditions and stuff like that. And we would stay at this apartment complex called the Oakwoods apartment, which was infamous for having a lot of child actors stay there. And Brianna's little sister, Chloe, used to act. And so her family and my family lived at that apartment complex at the same time. And I was 10 and she was 11. And that's when we first met. Yeah. And we stayed friends. We swapped AIM addresses. So one of our most popular episodes on the pod was when I was talking about the FIRE movement. It stands for Financially Independent Retired Early. And I'm not necessarily part of that because I don't want to retire. But I do love the idea of just being financially independent. I think it just gives you so many different options. And I love content on that topic because I just love hearing stories and tactics and things like that on saving money and earning more money and just being financially independent. And the best podcast on that topic is called Choose FIRE. They've been around for years, 6 or 7 years at this point. Tens of thousands of downloads, thousands and thousands of reviews. And the host's name is Brad. He's wonderful. And if you're into earning more, saving more, and being financially independent, that's something that I'm a big fan of. It's something that was my goal starting at the age of 20. Then you have to check them out. The host's name is Brad. He's amazing. He's a big MFM listener. So he understands what we're about. And it's Choose FIRE. That's C-H-O-O-S-E And then FIRE, financially independent, so F-I. Choose FIRE. You can find it on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, wherever you get your podcasts. We're big fans of them. Check it out. And then it's just a cool story because you were supporting him. I imagine. I don't know what the life of an actor is like. But you were supporting him. And then now you guys are a team. It's honestly, it's like flip-flopped because his acting was much more lucrative than you think. When we first got married, he was on a series called X Company. He did three seasons of that. And he was a lead on that. And it does pay quite well. I don't know if I'm contractually even allowed to say, so I won't. But at the time, he was more supporting me. And then I was working. And I was a nanny at the time. So I wasn't bringing in huge amounts of money. And then I did the pet company stuff. And during that time, he wasn't working. So then I was supporting him. And now we've come to this even ground. We're working together and supporting each other and our family, my sister, my brother-in-law, my little brother. Everyone quit their jobs and they're all working on our team. So it really just is a family operation. We go to coffee shops every day. They help us edit. They help us manage the house. They're watching our baby right now so we could do this. My brother-in-law, Christian, mixes and masters all the music. He produces a lot of it. That whole carrot flute, he played that on the recorder. So yeah, we keep it all in the family. We all swap who supports who. And I knew, I'm like, one day there's going to be a point where we can all just support each other with this big thing. But I don't know what's going to be. I wasn't expecting it to be Connor rapping at all. We had a guy on the pod a long time ago. You might know him. His name is Mike Brown. And it's one of the earlier episodes. And I forgot what he was doing exactly. It was some like mineral exploration thing. So he would go, he would basically knock on people's houses and be like, hey, did you know there's like some minerals under the ground that you live in? And if you sign this paper that says like, cool, you have the rights to like get those minerals out, dig those minerals out or whatever, mine them. You can get paid this amount of money today. Upfront, you can get this amount of money today. And if he got like, if there was 100 houses, he needed all 100 to sign. And if he got that, then he could sell that bundle of letters saying, yep, you have the rights to a company that actually does the mining. And he was making millions of dollars doing this in Texas. And he was like, yeah, I was doing this. And I was like, that doesn't sound like it takes a lot of people. He's like, no, it was just me. And then he's like, I brought on my two brothers. And I was like, oh, what's that like working with family? Because like, you know, you hear different things. This is before I started a business with my wife. I was like, you know, what's that like? And he's like, he just looked at me like I was stupid. And he was like, what do you mean? So it's the best. And I go, oh, I mean, I guess you guys get along or works out. He's like, no, of course, you know, it's not all perfect. But he's like, my theory of life is you find the people that you love, and then you do life with them. And that just like has been ringing in my ears for like three years now. It's like find people you love, and then do life with them find excuses to do things with them, whether it's work vacation or learning something together or joining us learning a sport together, whatever it is. Would you say that's accurate for you guys? Or do you guys have anything that maybe will ring in my ears for another three years about this? I'd say I'd say it's accurate. But there definitely are like we have to plan date nights or else we will never spend time together as a married couple. We turn into just business partners for a while. And that's it. Or like, for example, we'll get in an argument as married couples do. But then we have a podcast interview the next morning or a video to shoot. So we have to put aside our pride of like who's right or wrong to make the work come first or my siblings. If they get in a fight. I just had this talk with them last week. I'm like, you guys are messing up my ecosystem. We have like a family ecosystem right now. If you fight with you, then now Connor can't mix his music with him. And then if he's so everyone just freaking get along. So sometimes I have to like that person that's like stop fighting because business. You're fucking up the juju. Yeah, literally. And then I'm like, there's a point where we're going to sell everything, make a ton of money, and then we can all live on a farm and fight all we want. But for now, freaking get along. And you just did a so like, the way that this is transferring to like actual wealth and money and everything is the Spotify, you get paid off that I don't know if you can get paid off Tick Tock or not, but you just did a tour as well. So you, you and hoodie Alan did like a I think what did you say two or three weeks? It was three weeks in Europe. Yeah, I was opening for him. I actually wrote down our revenue streams just because I didn't want to forget. I'd say go for it. Yeah, it's like Sam's gonna ask about revenue streams. I better be prepped. We have streaming is the number one by far. We have YouTube money. YouTube actually pays quite well in in regards to social media platforms. YouTube is like the platform. Yeah, I'll just say this really quick because this is kind of cool. So I found out that in them. So I was pretty late to YouTube shorts. I watched a Mr. Beast podcast where he was talking about, you know, YouTube shorts being the future data. I was like, all right, let me just try this. And what I did was I took all my popular Tick Tocks and because I edit them, I have them all on my computer saved and I just repurpose them on shorts. And you know, without the Tick Tock watermark or anything, I took the original, you know, and just repost and then YouTube emailed us and they're like, you were the most subscribed to artist in November. Yeah. And all artists in the month of November. Yeah. They said I was just right. Damn right. Send. I said, is there like a plaque for that or something? Yeah. So I got 800000 subscribers in one month just just from posting every day for a full month. All my popular videos, including the I heard something funny, by the way. I don't know if this is true or not. Might be a conspiracy theory, but somebody was saying, like, obviously, this part was, I think, showed to be true, which is if you just reupload your Tick Tocks with the watermark like Instagram and YouTube, I think we're deprioritizing it like it. But so the original file is good, but actually they also scraped the metadata, the name, the file name. I don't know if you guys are. Is this true or are you guys aware of this? If if you have the same like MP4 file name underneath, they also are trying to match that to just see like, oh, shit, we should start. Somebody told me. I don't know if that's true or not. It could it could be possible. I don't care. Like that globe video. We didn't change any, which is kind of weird that they both they both have exactly 72 million views on both platforms. And I posted them months apart because like I said, I was late to shorts. So now because of YouTube, that's an extra five figure. So yes, that's that's why I brought that up. Was I which one grows faster? YouTube shorts or Tick Tock? What do you wear? Which horse do you see winning? It's tough because the Tick Tock algorithm changes so much. But I think right now we're more excited about YouTube because YouTube lets you pin a comment and a link to stream the song. But Tick Tock doesn't. They removed the pinned comment feature. So it's harder to convert Tick Tock views to streams right now. I had a call with Tick Tock and I said, bring that back. So hopefully they bring it back. And even more interestingly enough on Tick Tock there. So it'd be my manager. Right. This is amazing. YouTube is much more creator friendly as far as you know, when you want to promote something like that, that video, that first globe video that I post on YouTube, I was able to make the pin comment the streaming link for the song. And that comment has like 40,000 upvotes. And so it definitely allow people to get to the streaming way easier than Tick Tock. Tick Tock at this point to even if you try to write the word link in bio or even Spotify, they'll hide the comment. And we've tested this. I've written that I posted that comment under my own video, logged into a different account to go there and the comments gone. And so they don't want to encourage anybody off the app, obviously. So it's this but finish this out. So it's Spotify, YouTube, then brand deals. Okay, recently, like the last couple, you can negotiate like six figures, high six figures, depending on the ask, I'm sure we could get even higher. But like, in our current state, current followers, it's like six figure deals, syncs, which is like getting your songs and commercials or TV, video games, video games, all that stuff. Publishing. Can you explain publishing real quick in like two sentences? It's hard to explain in two sentences. But yeah, pretty much like a song has two parts to it. There's like the master, which is also called the sound recording, which is what the streams are. Yeah, what the streaming royalties are. And then there's the publishing side, which is like the writers, the songwriters. And so the publishing, you get paid for like performance rights. So if it gets played on the radio, if someone wants to cover your song and use your lyrics, so it's sort of like a different part of the pie that So pub and then merch and then live shows. So those are like our 1-2-3-4-5-6, like seven streams of revenue. And people don't know this, like... Are you negotiating all this? I mean, that's very impressive if you're the one also doing the publishing stuff and commercials and things like that. I mean, that's... I was up until like, three months ago for the syncs, I still am. Like if he needs to get his stuff in a TV show or movie or game, I'm still doing that. But for brand deals, we brought on a brand agent team because I just don't have the bandwidth. I was like losing my mind because being a mom comes first. And if Jude is sick or having a tough day and things are due, I'm like, I need someone else to take this. So we do have a brand agent negotiating the brand deals, but everything else is us. And so you have these revenue streams. Most of the time, I've heard that touring is like number one for a lot of artists. You put it at the bottom. We were just talking about this on a walk last night. I'm like, how are we going to talk about touring? Because it's just not... I don't like to speak confidently on anything we've never done ourselves. Of course, if you're at like Drake, Taylor Swift level, you're bringing in hundreds and millions of dollars. But just for context, we opened on the European tour and I had a chart of the money. I'm pretty sure we just broke even on that one. Just because you have to like rent a bus, you have to pay a tour manager, you have to pay for everyone's travel, your DJ, merch, like the list is endless. How do you think about that? Because it's obviously a lot of effort. You got a little baby at home. You probably reduce your output on TikTok because you're touring because it takes up so much time. You're breaking even. But there's the fan love and you're like, okay, this means something and that matters. And I think most artists just give you the politically correct like, oh, I do everything for my fans and blah, blah, blah. But there's a reality. There's trade-offs to everything. Me and Sam experienced this in a super small level with the podcast where we did a couple of live shows. They're fun, but they're a lot of work. You don't make any money off of it. And it's kind of like, well, that was one episode. We could have just done so much more in that same amount of time. Sam doesn't like to travel and I got little babies at home, so I'm not looking to travel either. So we kind of don't do it that much. How do you guys measure that? Think about that trade-off of the live fan experience, which creates super fans, but you lose all this other stuff. We found a really good medium for this. We met in the middle. Connor's booking agent. I totally forgot to mention her earlier, which is ridiculous because she's iconic. Connor's booking agent. Her name is Kara Lewis. She also repped Eminem and a bunch of other really awesome artists. And I've talked to her about it. Only white rappers she likes? Yeah. Oh my God. Yeah, Young Gravy. Who else? She's got it. She had Travis Scott at one point. She's got Ice Spice right now. She's literally the best. There's an article about her and it's called the most terrifying woman in music. I'm like, I want that to be me. That's me next. Anyways, so we've come to a conclusion with her that right now, while Jude is in these early stages of life, and we're really just trying to build, build, build, we'll do pop-up shows. So for example, we're doing a pop-up show in Chicago in November. And then we're going to do a pop-up show in Toronto, his hometown, a few days later. And then he'll accept festivals. Like a month ago, he went to Calgary for a rodeo and he did a festival where they offer you a certain amount of money and you play for 45 minutes. I'm like, easy. He's gone for two nights. So we're going to do that. And then just keep doing pop-up shows to have fan love and connect with the audience because it is really magical to hear people sing his songs back to him in person. But the TikTok experience is good too, though, because the thing about digital stuff is I see it. And even though I see 100,000 likes or 10s of millions of views on it, I'm like, I don't know who else knows this. And then I saw the video of you in Europe. And you do really cool TikToks of you before the show and then during the show. And I'm like, holy shit, this is a movement. It's like when Casper and all these companies... When digital companies start advertising and buying billboards in the subways and shit like that, you're like, oh, it actually adds value to see it in real life as opposed to just on my phone, even as a digital viewer. You know what I mean? Totally. That's a great comparison. Yeah. Yeah. So for us right now, shows aren't like live shows. A festival is a money thing. It is a revenue stream because he gets paid for like 45 minutes. But the concept of touring for us, it wouldn't be lucrative enough at this stage for us to invest the time, energy, funds, blah, blah, blah into it. But when he does do shows, it's purely fans. I know a lot of artists will charge for VIP meet and greets. I'm like, why am I charging a fan to say hi to you? They're the reason we have a career. No. He'll stand outside and talk to absolutely everybody there for free. He'll go to the merch tables, sign merch. The venues will try and even fee us for that. They're like, if he's at the merch table, there's gonna be a fee. I'm like, that's so silly. But anyways, when we do do live shows, it's gonna be completely just for the fans and not a revenue stream. How big of a venue can you sell out right now, you think? We've honestly never tested that because we've never done a headlining solo show, but I'll get back to you in a few weeks when we do. What's your guess? You can guess. Our hope is somewhere between 900 and 1000. Those are like the... Oh, dude, you're gonna crush that. Well, hey, you know, it's like... Here's the thing. So I mean, technically, who knows? You could sell out a 5000 venue. You never know. But in the touring world, you have to build a proof of purchase first. So you can't just go from zero to booking a massive venue. You have to start at this venue, and then your booking agent can negotiate this venue. And then this because you have to show them, hey, he sold X many tickets here. So now your venue should take him because you have to negotiate with the promoters and the club owners. So it's hard to say. Touring is a tough topic because one, we're not versed in it enough. And two, it's too complicated of a business to be like, I can go from here to here. You have to build. It's not as much like TikTok where we can go viral overnight and your life changes. Yeah, it's true. Sorry if that's a lame answer, but it's just... So Mike Posner went to my college when I was there. And we were all like, this is a guy in the other building that's trying to become a rapper. What is he talking about? And then he did. So that was amazing. And one of the things he did when he came back, so he had his high the traditional way. And then he hit a low where he wasn't making hits anymore. His first album was Whatever Big. And then he dipped a little bit. And then he reinvented himself. And he's like, I'm going to walk across America. So he started doing things that I thought were interesting because they added new layers to him, new dimensions, new content. Kind of like ideas. He wasn't doing it for that reason, but it worked well also. And he would do these pop-up shows just in a park where he would just be like, I'm just gonna start playing in this park and see what happens. But it kind of didn't matter what happened live. Some people got a magical experience that came or were there. Most people weren't there. But he's like, what does it matter if... Okay, let's say there's 50 people here that are having a 100 out of 10 experience because something over-the-top cool just happened. And okay, I don't have 900 other people here, but this video looks so interesting and it makes me more interesting than how a traditional artist does it. So the content would always pop off and his brand would be kind of like the people's champion in a way that he would just do these free shows in the park rather than how an artist would traditionally do things. So I think there's something to flipping touring on its head and be like, I am going to do these fan things on my own terms, but I'm actually going to do them optimized for content and not filling venues because content is my game anyways. If I just keep building that mountain, right? That's what Mr. Beast does. He's like, if I just keep building this mountain on digital, that's what will work. Like everything in this business, it's like, what's your goal? If your goal is to be a mega superstar and perform in arenas, then yeah, sign with a label and do those things and dedicate your life to building your touring resume so you can get there. But that's just not our goal, at least right now. So we're just focusing on making as much music as possible because I forgot who said, I think it was this artist named Mike stud. He compared songs to real estate. He's like, if you can buy a piece of real estate every two weeks, why wouldn't you? Some of them will remain shacks on the beach, but some of them will be mansions in Laguna. So that's our mindset right now. I'm like, we're investing in as much real estate. What is your goal? What's like your, what's like, do you guys have like a, like, do you want to do this for 30 years? Are you trying to just get super rich? I mean, what's like, what do you write on the whiteboard or on the fridge? Business business, like he loves the art and we love to make good music, but ultimately the goal would be to scale this, like we would scale a business and then potentially sell the catalog someday. Cause it can be evaluated similar to a, what number, what number excites you? 50 million. At what age? Three or four years from now. Yeah. Okay. I'll be your advisor. No charge. Just add a zero to that number. Okay. Cause that you're like, you guys, uh, 50 is you guys, you're already fingertips away. Fine. Sean, how's a hundred million? No, no. Out of 500 is the number. What did Bruce Springsteen get, dude? I think Bruce Springsteen got 300. You know, I want to say something here. That's a little bit, so I've definitely, uh, this is probably the most I've ever like, you know, complimented any guest on this podcast before. I'm usually, even if I like them, I, you know, I'm hard to get a little bit. Uh, Sam's usually just like Sam, Sam usually fangirls pretty easily. He's like, he's like, so you're hot. And I just love people that are hot and like, you know, you're fit. So like, you know, you're awesome. And, uh, you know, I usually keep it, you know, a little close to the vest, but, but you guys are, you're the, you're the creative version of hot. And I think that's amazing. And you're hot. Thank you. We'll take the physical as well. The thing that I would say that's kind of an insult is when I watched you on YouTube, I didn't have the same fun as I did on TikTok. So like, I watched the full songs and I was like, these are good songs, but I didn't like, you know, I wasn't like hooked. And I wasn't, um, like I wasn't as like, I felt like the things you guys are doing on TikTok. I've kind of never really seen before. It felt.
so original, and it almost felt like a different thing than like music, which is like a thing I understand. And there's a bunch of like pre-established music options that I can go to. I'm curious, do you guys feel this? A, do you feel the same way? And B, like, is there any part of your ego that's like, no, I like, I want to be a traditional, take me serious rapper versus like, no, this kind of like these TikTok quick hooks, almost like half songs, that's my thing. And I'm actually creating a new lane over here. How do you think about it? The goals are different on those platforms. On TikTok, our goal is to reach new listeners. And YouTube is more to nurture the listeners we already have and to nurture the platform because it does pay well. So more views on YouTube is more money in our pocket from the AdSense and stuff like that. But yeah, with YouTube, we're not approaching those long form videos with the goal of reaching new people, if that makes sense. It's kind of hard to explain. And then also sometimes if the videos are a bit more polished, like for example, he did a song with Baby No Money. And that was a very polished music video. But like, that's like baby's team, right? They were like, all right, if we're gonna do a song with Connor, Connor's got to jump into our world and do a music video. I'm like, great, then you got to jump in our world and do a skit. So yeah, well, the thing about your skits is like, first of all, like I see a TikTok video and then I listen to you guys when I work out like I associate it goes video first, then I listen to while I'm exercising. That's our goal. But when I see the video, like you do this, you have this amazing thing where you basically, you're clearly an actor, you have three characters, you have the producer, then you have you the rapper, and then you've got your nerdy brother or cousin or whoever you're supposed to be the guy. Yeah, like the guy who wears the turtleneck. And I get to know the characters. And you do such a good job. I was telling Sean, I was like, I forget you forget that it's you, it's Connor, you do even obviously, it's you don't dress up or anything, just the same person, you do such a good job that I'm getting to know the characters. It's very much like the Dr. Doolittle or whoever it was, well, you know, Tyler Perry, where they played the it's the same actor doing multiple characters, but you're not even dressed up. I get to know the characters. And I like see the weird brother come in. And I'm like, Oh, he's about to do something funny. And I get to know the personality of the producer version of you. It's so good. You do such a good job of like, adding characters that when I listened to the songs, I am like, I'm remembering that video. And that's what makes me like it. Whereas if it was just the songs, they are good. But I the the skits add so much meaning to it. I'm like, Oh, this is the carrot one. You know what I mean? So cool. And the funny thing is, so like, like music, like if you listen to an album, they've always done these like skit type things. And I'm like, back when I used to have CDs, like Kanye's, you know, college dropout album, there would be these little skits, but they weren't that good. And like, they weren't that funny. They were kind of long. And like, so that concept's been around. How did you guys come up with this idea to have these characters? How did you come up with the idea for the characters? Like, what was the inspo behind that? The characters was really just like, we don't have anyone else. Like, we're really like, we don't really hang out with many people. We couldn't think of anyone who could play these characters as well. So I'm like, I'm just freaking put on glasses and just be. Yeah, it was just, it really was just the most efficient way to do it. And I, I had control over the whole process because I was, I film it all myself. I set up my iPhone. Film them late at night when the, it's like, well, you can't coordinate that with other people. Like, hey, can you, can you come over at 11 p.m. for a TikTok? Like no one's going to do that. So we just do a good job of getting, like, you have this other video. I forget. I don't even know who the rappers are. Like, eventually I figure out, oh, that's Hoodie Allen. But in the video, I'm just like, oh, it's the skit is like, it's a late night thing. The janitor has to fill in. And I just know the actor as the janitor, not even the rapper. Then you see him rap it. It's really good. This is like really creative stuff. We would love to, our dream would be to like, almost make a, not a parody, but of like the office, but call it the studio where we can kind of extend these characters a bit more and like go a bit deeper into them and maybe bring on a few new, like if we have a episode of the studio where Connor's all these characters and then the guest is like Idris Elba comes in and he acts on it. And then we get Courtney Cox to come in on the next episode. And we use these connections Connor has from acting to now elevate his TikTok skits. That'd be fun. And then I have another dream of like pitching spin the globe to Netflix. I'm like, how cool would that be? If it's a 45 minute episode of Connor spinning the globe, lands on a country, but then he actually flies there and we meet the artists and we see their culture and we see the music scene there. Like, for example, Zambia, we have to go there because it would blow your mind. He couldn't send us his video because he only had 12 hours of electricity allotted like per day. And he said, until we get a heavy rain, the government will not increase our electricity. So I can't send you my video clips. So we were waiting to post this episode because you don't have electricity in Zambia to send these videos. So I'm like, I want to go there and see this and like bring awareness to it. And I think that'd be so cool because you have food shows on Netflix. You have like Zac Efron changing the world. Everybody feeds Phil. Everybody or somebody feed Phil. Yeah, I'm like, Connor should go there and do that. But for music, I think that'd be so sick. Well, there's a few there's a few like paths here, I think. And there's a few examples. One example, which I'm not relating it as an insult, but Weird Al Yankovic. Like, I bet you I don't know this for sure. But I would bet you that Weird Al probably out earned most every artist from the 90s. I bet you he crushed it in terms of obviously it was in the CD era where it was $22 for a CD that costs 50 cents to make. But I bet you Weird Al crushed it. And then the other guy and again, I'm not saying it's just because he's another white rapper, but Lil Dicky, you know, he's got that awesome show Dave. He's done a really good job of parlaying this thing into more than just music and rapping. You know what I wish Dave did though, which I was so disappointed in? The songs on the track were so good. And he's just now releasing them. I'm like, those songs should have been out because I would have streamed it. So not only are you making money from your show, but you're also making money because your Spotify is about to go up. So that's another thing. If we were to spin the globe, all the songs would be out. You watch the episode and then you can instantly stream it. Yeah. That's another part of our rollout is we don't promote the song until it's out. Some people promote the song months in advance. They do pre-save campaigns and stuff like that. What were you going to say about that, Sam? Well, what I was going to say was Weird Al and Dave are like, I actually think Weird Al is even more talented than Dave, but they're both like this, like, cutesy type of thing. I actually don't view you that way. I view you as significantly more serious. You're not like, I'm laughing with you, never at you. Whereas with Dave, it's usually at, you know what I mean? But he's still done a really good job of taking these over the top music videos and turning them into a thing. But I actually think that you have more potential than him for sure. Because with you, you're relatable, but at the same time, aspirational. And like, you're still serious, but at the same time, funny. I don't know. That's such a nice compliment, but it's so hard to respond to because that's just hard to respond to. I don't know how else to word it. But we love Dave, and little Dickie is so good. I just admire you guys. I think that you both have the it factor, and it's so evident. And I think the reason Sean said add a zero to it was because we don't know anything about music, but we've hung out with a whole bunch of rich people, a lot of billionaires and shit. And you see some patterns in certain things. And it's like, oh, well, this is... Yeah, we don't know how big this is going to be. It's already big, but it's going to be significantly larger than the way it is now. If you have a little bit longer of a time horizon, you just keep doing pretty good. How long does it take you to create a video or a video with a song? So what is the creative timeline for one of these that you make? It could be like... Are we talking the songs made or the song isn't made yet? Yeah, I guess either way. Or for example, the top video right now on your TikTok is this collab, the branded collab that you did with Ruffles and KFC. So you did that. I assume you basically had to... You made something specific for that. It wasn't something you already had made, right? Correct. So how long does a process like that take you when you're going to create something from scratch? Or is it just some days it's one day, some days it's three months? It's hard to say. Do you have a consistent formula for creation? For songs, some days it can be three hours and some days it can be weeks because he's stuck on something. But for videos, I'll script something in like 20, 30 minutes and then he'll film himself for a few hours and then he'll edit for a few hours. Yeah, on average, I'm probably filming for one or two hours and then editing for one to three hours. And do they all have to be full songs or do you just do like, I make three verses and that's for this TikTok video, but I'm not turning it into a full song? Do you ever do that? No. Now we only will invest time in a TikTok if it can convert to streams or else that's just not lucrative for us. I have a brain fart. But yeah, for Ruffles, they only requested a 30-second demo. So for that one specifically, he only had to write 30 seconds of a song. Boom, done, easy. But normally, it's a full song, needs to be done or we won't post it. Because TikTok doesn't pay you for views. Yeah, but it does indirectly because let's say something goes viral, now your fan base grows, the next video you put out with a song, it's gonna pay. Oh, totally. But if the song is out, we can show you the charts, it'll be like, it's so much different if the song's out. Yeah, but I hear what you're saying. But I admire people who kind of like, there's a temptation. Anytime you're doing something new, because new stuff is so unproven, there's a tendency and a temptation to take the energy and the momentum from the new thing, but shift into the proven game. So for example, I did a comparison once of Joe Rogan's podcast, which is like an interview, talk show type of thing. And I compared it to the top, the Tonight show. And I was like, okay, I forgot who was the host or which show I did, but let's say Jimmy Fallon was the host of the show. And it's basically like, if you just compare across every key metric, so it's like audience size, Joe's podcast blows away Jimmy Fallon, and actually has for years and years and years. Once Joe got the Spotify deal, then it was like, it got kind of legitimized. But way before that, Joe was making a ton of money in a huge audience, like five years before that. But people didn't think of it like a business because they just didn't have a headline of $100 million a year to Spotify to latch on to. So audience size, Joe is bigger. Production, it's Joe's podcast, I think is Joe, Jamie, and like maybe one other person's like three or four people total to pull off that show. The Tonight Show has like 50 people behind the scenes just to like run one show. Like episodes per year, he has like more output with fewer people, bigger reach. And the only thing that was missing was like, it didn't have like a category that it fit into really, it was like, oh, it's a podcast. Okay, podcast, like is that a business? I don't really know, like, seems like there's a bunch of those. But Joe stuck with it. And like, he had a lot of offers to do other things, but he just stuck with it. Let it build, build, build, build, build. So that then by the time, you know, it got really, really big, he could promote whether it's his own product, like Onnit, or some other, you know, athletic greens or whatever, some product that pays him and start making ludicrous money. And Mr. Beast kind of does the same thing where like, he flirts with this idea of like, I could go create a Netflix show. But the reality is, if you talk to him, and you've seen him do what he's been doing over the last few years, it's just like, build audience, build audience through this, like, he's like, why would I leave YouTube? I can reach more people in the Super Bowl. And you're like, yeah, but it's different. But he's kind of not wrong. Like he is right. It seemed like this frivolous thing. And then now people see Mr. Beast is like kind of a business entrepreneur guy. But like, it's because of like, it's because he committed to this new lane like many years ago. And I guess what I would say for you guys is, it seems like you guys have a new lane of this kind of like, what I'm it's almost like fast fashion, but for music, which is like these tech talks that are hooky, and and catchy and skit based, and like they can get millions of views and build you a huge fan base. And I actually think if you just stay with that, and you don't try to be a traditional musician, you're going to end up way bigger than all the traditional musicians. If the problem is, it's just like a little bit unproven where that goes exactly. Or like, and it's very tempting to like take offers from legitimate brands and legitimate paths, as you've heard of. But the good news is you're making millions of dollars along the way you're making millions now. So at least it's at least you ain't broke. And we've talked to every major label. It's not like I, our friend Nick said that he's like, we're independent by choice, not by default. Because you'll see in the comments like, why hasn't anyone signed this kid yet someone signed Connor and I'm like, they've tried. We will not because that's not our goal. Our goal is to like do this ourselves do things the way we want to do it. And honestly, prove to other people that you can do it. Because I had no idea that this was possible. And I'd love for other people that are making music to know it too. How old are you guys? I'm 29 and Connor's 28. Wow. And early on, I remember you had this cool video with Courtney Cox. And then you had another one with what's his name? Idris. Yeah. Those are cool. Have you had any other like heroes or celebrities reach out that you that floored you? There's one guy I really look up to his name is Russ. He's a huge, yeah, he's a huge independent artist. He really kind of wrote the blueprint that I followed. If you want to talk to someone about independent touring, it would be Russ because I know Russ does it and he sells out massive like, if you want to talk about the financial part, the business part of touring, he'd be the one to talk to. His song Civil War gets me pumped up. Great song. Yeah, he's he's amazing. But yeah, Russ, Russ reached out. Yeah, so he like DM'd and showed love, which is just really cool because he's sort of been my North Star as far as just like how to do this independently. He wrote like, unsolicited advice, stay independent, you'll be making Ms like clockwork. And I'm like, that's all I needed to hear. Like, thanks, Russ. That was that was a really cool one for me. He only talks and raps too. That's amazing. His DMs are also raps. It's so hard because the DMs are so like Simu reached out. Yeah, he he's amazing. Yeah, I can't I'm like, you know, when people ask you a question on the spot and you're like, name a song and you're like, I don't know any songs. Yeah, there'll be random things where like, I'll notice on TikTok like, oh, Logan Paul like the video or T-Pain like the video like, you know, there'll be little things like that. That's cool. As far as like directly talking to someone, the big one that comes to mind is Russ just because he's someone who I'm trying to emulate as far as the business goes. I know you're in Vegas. Is it translating into off the screen stuff? You know, are you walking around downtown Vegas and people are coming up to you? Has that been happening? Yeah, that's been the weirdest part because like I said, we stay in our bubble and we hadn't been leaving the house much, especially during COVID. And then we went on a trip to Salt Lake City because we love Utah. It's so random, but we went there and it was a ton. And especially at the airport, like the TSA agents are always like, oh, my God, wait, like, look at his ID and then be like, the music guy. Like, we love your stuff. And I'm like, that's crazy. But the best is when little kids come up and they have their little, are you a YouTuber? And they're so cute. And it's like, hey, yeah, what's up? And we had like a five-year-old super fan come to Calgary to meet him at the rodeo. And Connor took him to Tim Hortons for donuts. But yeah, that's really cool because you get to see it translate in real life and especially when it's kids. And you're like, oh, that could have been like a core memory for that kid. That's really cool. Now that you are winning in one lane, what I've found is that when people are, let's say, winning and let's say that right now you're winning in like this content music game, you'll often see it's like kind of like Neo in the Matrix. You sort of see the game a little differently. You sort of see opportunities that, you know, like, oh, I feel like other people could be doing this in this other lane or we could do this, but, you know, we think that would work, but, you know, we just have our hands full, so we're not going to do it. But like, have you seen any, what I call adjacent opportunities for either content creators or on the business side? Like, have you, you've come from a business brain, right? So like, do you see other opportunities? I just had one the other day.
