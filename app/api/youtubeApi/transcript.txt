The Joe Rogan Experience do you think we're ever going to come to a time in this country where internal combustion engines are outlawed I don't think so man I really don't I think it's I think you're going to see that like come full circle just in my opinion oh outlawed or gone away because well because alcohol was outlawed as once for for as well yeah it take California out of the equation though I mean that but that's what they're doing is crazy you can't buy new internal combustion engines after 2035. and I think this is like 20 something other states fixing to adopt it the same way because you can do it without a vote yeah it's crazy they did it without a vote I don't think it makes sense I really don't I don't think there's enough minerals in the ground I don't think they just the mining alone that would have to happen and the the reality of what happens in that mining like people you need to understand what they're talking about they're talking about batteries like this this idea that batteries just come from fairies and that now all of a sudden you have this like zero carbon impact vehicle like that's nonsense that's complete total nonsense you you're ignoring the entire Supply process of what it takes to make that what is it with people that they don't they won't recognize that they don't want to recognize that some people didn't know about it until I had this guy on my podcast said Darth Cara who wrote a book about it and he went to the Congo to show these illegal Minds like what they're doing I mean it's not illegal there's no law right but they have children working in these mines they have women working in these mines with babies on their back and they're they're mining toxic Cobalt and this stuff is I mean there's no protection there's no safety these people are like chipping the [ __ ] out of the ground and that's a good percentage of all the Cobalt that's involved in electronics and batteries and cell phones and all the things that we need and it's not very publicized it's it's this man exposed it and he risked his life to do it and he wrote a great book about it and the podcast was it was insane like listening to his story and how he risked his life to get this footage and you know and there were several times where there was men's guns and he got questioned and he had you know a bunch of people that were helping him but he got out of there eventually with this reality that everybody now is faced with it's like this is how they get the stuff that you need to run your cell phone like stop thinking that you know you have zero impact if you're buying this you're contributing to this we all are and we don't want to keep our [ __ ] heads buried in the ground and pretend it's not happening and to say that like everything has to be electronic like slow down like where is this coming from who's making it who what what are the conditions like in the places where these people have to put your phone together what are the conditions like do you know dude Foxconn has Nets around the building because people were jumping off what yeah where they make iPhones they they put Nets around the building because so many people are committing suicide so instead of windows they're working constantly they work constantly they sleep there beds underneath their desks or their work areas and it was sleep underneath work sleep work show the photo of the uh Nets around Fox it's bun yeah look at that you know how Wild that is like if you're gonna jump off a building you can't do it here get out of here or if you do you better have a good aim man you gotta aim for it there's no net how do you explain that to people like when you're walking Executives into the building without a huge bird problem we've had a huge bird how crazy that is you've had so many people commit suicide and your solution is putting Nets around the building those people just go up to the top floor [ __ ] this bang I wanted to be over just lock them like all the casinos do just lock the windows it's the roofs to do maintenance there's just got to be like better representation of both sides so that people understand well really we should be making phones in America and they should be American-made American wages where people get health and dental and all the stuff you're supposed to get and you have a living wage that's what it's supposed to be and if your phone costs a little more to do that and if Apple makes a little less that's how it's supposed to be you're not supposed to be using slave labor to do stuff and you know we don't have an ethical Choice it's not like if you want to be a part of today's society you kind of have to have a smartphone if you're answering emails and doing business it's way more convenient to do that than not have one and there's not like this like very obvious ethical Choice like hey this company only uses high-paid labor everybody has Insurance there's none of that if they only work x amount of hours a day there's none of that you you get these things and they're all manufactured overseas if is it 20 30 is the year is that what California's law I think it's 20 35 yeah if if they were to do that and say it was Nationwide right and no new cars after 2020 2035 can beat but they don't touch I mean obviously you're not gonna be able to do anything with it what's existing any of the ice Motors that are out there that's gonna be like it's gonna be like Judge Dredd yeah imagine what the cost of like a 2020 F-150 would be worth then maybe more desirable or less desirable I mean there's good I mean I would assume that at least 50 something percent of the population is gonna be like [ __ ] that I'm never going that I'm gonna keep buying my yeah my gas Motors right well the the thing that always is going to be an issue with uh cars is charging them takes time right so you have to sit there so if you're if you're fully out of juice and you're on a cross-country trip how long does it take when you go to those supercharger stations to get you up to 100 again how long is that is it a few hours yeah longer than you want to be sitting there yeah so damn sure with Rising crime and having places where you know people are going to be stuck and no security especially in places like La good luck with that oh yeah my friend Eddie was telling a story the other day about he almost got robbed at a gas station and he realized these guys were coming towards him and he got out just in time but he's like you know how you you've been in your car so many times that you can just you know where everything is instantly you'd have to fumble he says if that's what saved me that I just jumped in my car and I knew how to and I was just moving already crazy the guy was moving towards him dude that's a little bit like the net scenario though like what's the problem that we're not solving that like quite the facts why are you afraid to go sit there and charge your car at the gas station well because you're gonna get [ __ ] robbed for sitting there is nobody looking at uh airline travel and the way planes are made with doing anything away with doing electric motors on that kind of [ __ ] there's a concept that's really currently being developed for a solar powered plan I talked to a guy about it like over a year ago and they were explaining it and they they have I think they've done a bunch of test flights and they're you know about then it's going to be able to go a long way I just don't know I don't know how that works you know I don't know like how much how much range does it have how safe is it like you know you don't want why is it you want to be an early adopter like flying cars like you see flying cars like yeah I'm gonna sit that out yeah people keep an eye on it you know yeah how many people fly into power lines you know how many people are going to fly into trees and start forest fires no I think that when they announce that in California wasn't like the next day they also had an announcement for people to stop charging their cars like a week later please don't charge that's the other thing it was so hot it maxed out the grid if everybody had an electric car The Strain on the grid would be Monumental I don't know if most grids the way they're set up right now would be able to handle that like if everybody had an electric car wouldn't that take like substantial upgrades to the grid dude it's just infrastructure Joe we just did you just like you just invest in infrastructure man I like how you're saying it like it makes sense you're so confident you think they're worried about all of that stuff or they know that it's impossible that's why you push it out to it's just looks really good on the ballot it does look really good on the ballot that's part of the problem this is a lot of people these knee-jerk reactions to like very complex nuanced problems like the environment like I had Mike Baker on uh yesterday and we talked about this and one of the things you're saying like the vast majority of the pollution the carbon emissions in the world is coming from China and India as the vast majority of it and they're not going to change they're not going to change what they do no matter what we do we're not going to put a dent in what they're doing and there's a bunch of people that think that the way to get us out of this and the way to mitigate climate change in terms of like human impact on it is actually to build up poorer communities and get them on the electrical system get nuclear power to these places or so or something and like Elevate their standard of Life you'll have less pollution you'll have less you'll have less Pro you'll definitely have less issues in terms of like Health consequences the people that live there and in turn as they become more you know sustainable they live a better life their lifestyle is better you'll have less pollution they just need it just people need to be incentivized like they need to have some sort of like there's places in the world that have no hope and they just burn tires they don't give a [ __ ] right right like they're not thinking about the environment they're thinking about how do I get by how do I stay alive I'm back to your point on making stuff here I don't know the numbers but I'm wondering what if you were to say in 10 years we're requiring 90 of every single thing we use to be made in the USA right so you cut out all that air freight and all that that freight line all the shipping with the shipping is huge and everyone wants to talk about providing jobs if we take if we take all that [ __ ] what does that do for the carbon footprint if we're not shipping all those Freighters yeah and we're building this [ __ ] here if you Google that and granted this is just me like looking at Google doing Google research but look at what is it look at what a container ship use uses in fuel consumption it's [ __ ] insane it's like the equivalent of like every single vehicle in the United States like in it annually like just it seems like a huge dent you'd put in it by us making this [ __ ] here and using it here that would be a big dent that would be massive there's I mean that's obviously a long-term project unfortunately manufacturing really kind of got out of the United States when they started shipping and building cars overseas and and ruined Detroit I mean Detroit just fell apart that Roger and Me movie you guys ever see that never said no never heard of it you never heard of it it's um what the [ __ ] his name Jamie Michael Moore Michael Moore that guy uh it's a great documentary and it's about Flint Michigan it's about right after they closed all the plants down and everybody just had nothing they had nothing to do and just like the city collapsed and all that happened because they wanted to make [ __ ] cheaper yeah they wanted to pay people less and it's more profitable for them to have uh you know their manufacturing plants in other countries dude it's nuts that was and that the one song for Whitey the other day yeah you know Whitey Morgan Countryside yeah I've heard the name he was on the podcast and we went to he did a local show and stuff like that he's from Flint and his dad and Granddad worked in the auto and he has a song and it was telling about it yeah we were talking to him about like Michigan it came up because you know we go to shows in Michigan and Michigan's got a very like Southern redneck pocket right very it's weird because of how North it is but he talked about all the people from the South moved up there for completely Auto jobs and all the wages right and it just it's that area but he talked about the same thing when it when they shut it down I mean it just killed that [ __ ] specifically Flint that's where he's from it's a horrible story and they did that because they wanted to make more money imagine knowing that you're gonna just destroy thousands of people's lives like instantly I'm not like yeah I want to make more money I'm not trying to put you on blast I really want to know on a normal let's see where this is going on a normal I like how the kids say that these days put you on blast well on a purchasing decision when you're going to buy something how big how does that weigh on you knowing that it's made in America well I'd like to buy everything made in America if it was possible I would like to buy everything made somewhere where people are paid fairly right that's what we that's like what should be the normal ethical exchange for everything if you go to a restaurant you want to know that everyone's being taken care of and paid fairly you know you you go to you buy a car from you guys you want to you want to pay you for your work it's like very it's a good Exchange that's that's what I think I like to think about and the thing that bums me out is if you're buying something that you know is made by people that are essentially slaves yeah I mean the people working in Fox what options do they have like what do they do is there an option to only work eight hours a day no like it's probably not but it's probably insane that using young people to do it too it's all [ __ ] sketchy
